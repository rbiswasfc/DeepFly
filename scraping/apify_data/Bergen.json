My older kids particularly liked the Sentrifugal-skapen which is a 360 deg “roller coaster” on the bicycle. The other was making bubbles that are as tall as us. Also a huge interactive physical model that allows kids to play with and understand the concept of hydro power generation. The list goes on.",

      "text": "I did the Vidden Trail, and thoroughly enjoyed the 4 or so hours, and 17 km, it took me to complete, including walking off Mt Floyen into town. The views were stunning and the remoteness so close a big city quite breath-taking.\n\nBut this is a serious hike. You need the right clothes, the right footwear for rock scrambling and mud, you need water and sustenance. There is no clear \"trail\" to speak of, rather a set of spread out markers and you get to pick your own way through the rocks to get to them. The markers are in the form of rock cairns, or simple bare metal poles sticking out of the earth. They are not signposted. I almost took a wrong turn in the first kilometer, starting from the Mt Ulriken end. There were times when I realized I had passed other people going the other way without even noticing them until they were well past me. Possibly other people were on the trail I never saw. It actually feels quite remote at its furthest from the city. At one point I was literally scrabbling up and down the rocks with my hands, all by myself.\n\nIf you go the other way, starting from Mt Floyen, closer to the city center, then everything is deceptively clear and easy to start with. This hike gets tough after descending the other side of Floyen though. I saw a triplet of naive American tourists in skimpy outfits and equally skimpy footwear, saying they could throw their shoes away, just after hitting the first of 10km of mud and rocks and before the first real climb. I have to wonder how much further they got.\n\nSo please take heed: this trail is not for everyone, it is not a gentle Sunday stroll through a park, there are no facilities between the beginning and end except for a few rescue huts. It's not safe for anyone that's not confident with a bit of off-trail walking.",

      "text": "I wouldn’t say it’s an easy hike at all mainly because you have to scramble over rocks and pick your own paths for for at least 8km. It was very much an up and down hike but certainly easier going from Mt Ulriken. If you are not sure footed and not happy to scramble over big rocks then I’d advise against walking there. We saw kids there but yet again unless they are like mountain goats you’d better walk elsewhere. The views were to die for and we loved the ever changing vistas. The reservoirs contain drinking water so we filled our water bottles up there (following the locals). Talking to locals they put the hike in the same category as Trolltunga and that is classified as extreme. ",

I should mention that it has been raining which makes conditions more slick. Also be sure to allow time for queue at the gondola. The line for us started at the entrance doorway and took about an hour. It is a beautiful hike even on a rainy day. ",

It took us about 6.5 hrs to complete the full hike, we stopped along the way to take pictures and enjoy the views, if we didn't stop as much we probably would have finished in 4.5 hrs. I would recommend starting at the top of Mt. Ulriken and finishing at Mt. Floyen. We took the cable car to the top of Mt. Ulriken, if you're feeling really ambitious you can hike to the top. The last 5th of the hike or so was on a gravel path or was paved, our legs thanked us for finishing with an easier walk at the end. We took the funicular back into the Bergen city center but one could walk down if they wanted to. This hike was difficult and one should be in good shape to do it. There were several parts where we had to climb up and down rocks like mountain goats carefully picking our path. We wore waterproof hiking shoes and dressed in layers. By the end of the trek we were a bit muddy and tired. For reference we are in our mid-20s and in moderate to decent shape. We have done a lot of hiking in the U.S. Rocky Mountain National Park and had somewhat of an idea of what to expect on the Vidden Trail. The path was well marked and while it wasn't very busy we did see other people on the trail.",

      "text": "My husband & I (30 y/o) with intermediate hiking experience and his two sisters (mid 20s) hiked this trail starting around 1030 am in early July. Weather was gorgeous; started with a light jacket and shorts but didnt need the jacket after the first hour. We took the My Ulriken cable car up; hiked the trail to Floyen and hiked down Floyen to our AirBNB which was so wonderfully situated right above the Floibanen station in Bergen. The main Vidden trail from the top of Ulriken to Summit of Foyen took us about 5 hours. We werent going particularly fast or slow; moderately paced taking lots of pictures. The weather was wonderful and the trail was great. It was a weekday but the trail was well traveled. Although we certainly didn't have it to ourselves,everyone on the trail was pleasant and respectful. There was plenty of space between hikers (most of the time people were just small dots ahead and behind). It was certainly NOT something that should keep you from doing the trail. Make sure to bring plenty of water & snacks (there is no where to get any along the way obviously). Bring layers for changes of weather as you are pretty exposed atop the fjord plateau if the weather takes a turn (luckily we had perfect weather the whole day through). Sunscreen is a must as the sun is intense up there. And bring your wallet for a drink at Floyen upon completion!\nRecs:\n- Definately start from Ulriken to Floyen; otherwise you have a lot of uphill\n- Use the restrooms at the top of Ulriken before you go -- again its exposed most of the hike so it can be difficult to find a private space.\n- Take the Ulriken up; we took a taxi from the Bryggen harbor to the loading site \n- Bring your camera it is absolutely stunning",

We wete lucky as it was a clear sunny day. The trail itself is easy to follow and well marked. There are a couple of rocky climbs so I would give this a moderate to grading. The hike with a number of nreaks to enjoy the scenes, took around 6 hours. It could probably be done on around 4.5 hours. At Ulriken yhe gondala down is about £28 each going down. The main trail down was closed but takes around 45 minutes. We had to take diversion, which for a couple of 50+ year olds was difficult and not recommended. The climbs were very rocky and steep. On a wet day this would be quite dangerous. Overall We really enjoyed it.",

The start is right behind the restaurant at the top of the mountain, and has 300 meters down to base. (end of the line). You can order your ticket online by looking up: Ulriken Zip line. This is known as the fastest Zip line in Norway. And the price of 300 NOK it`s a must to try. Breathtaking view, if you manage to concentrate on that. During your ride. Have fun.",

Of course, just stay there and enjoy the view moment is also interesting.\nThere’re many nationality visitors coming over here. Everyone is exciting once he/she   climbs on top of hill. \nIf time limited without budget concerned, suggest taking tour package. There’re several hills around Bergen. This is highly recommended. \nWell prepared, then you will definitely love it.\n\n禦寒衣物要穿上、避免受寒。有高像素攝影機也是必須。\n總之、來了就不會後悔。從這到另一個景點Floyen 大約13Km 路程。若登頂，再步行下山也是不錯選擇。\n",

You buy the tickets near the Bryggen and then hike the swindling alleys up halfway the mountain. But actually as you come as far up as taking the \"train\" ride up you have almost same view over the city as on top.\nYes take the hike up and enjoy the older very beautiful buildings but I suggest to save money and go to the Ulrikken instead.

It started to rain. The locals didnot notice. They continued. I unfolded my umbrella, passed the halfway mark. It stated that I still had 509 steps to go. We reached the top. The rain stopped. We took some nice photos of Bergen before we continued our walk. We walked another route that took us back to the center of town. A lovely walk. We are 66 and 69 and not overly sporty.",

You can get a parking ticket here that allows you to park on street like residents.\n\nThe view is definitely worth to go. Just be sure to wear sport shoe and not carry too much.

In beautiful natural surroundings you can meet both masters and servants from the past. Lunch at Gamle Bergen Tracteursted which is open June-August (closed mondays). Both the park and the restaurant can be visited without a ticket. Museumshop/small cafe. Open 2. may - 12 may from 10-15, 13. May (closed 17.

It isn’t big and not fantastic. But what there is, is okay. It costs 120Nkr entrance, which is a lot for what it is. We had the Bergen Card, somitnwas free:)) ",

      "text": "The Old Bergen Museum is an open air museum where wooden buildings from the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries have been set up as a village.  The landscaping and views of the sea from the hilltop are very nice.  However, for us, it was a case of “been there, done that”.  The buildings are similar to the ones in Bergen’s city center and other Scandinavian cities.  The houses were open for viewing, but we only walked into three of them.  We had read that there were performances and people dressed in period costumes, but we never saw any.  Perhaps we would’ve enjoyed the museum more if it had not been raining.  We just wanted to get out of the rain and cold.  The museum is not for people with mobility issues as this place requires walking uphill on cobblestones. ",

You can take buses 3, 4, 5 and 6 and I think also some with higher numbers and get of at Gamle Bergen stop, cross the bridge over the road, go down the stairs on the left, go down the road towards the sea, and once the wall on the other side of the street ends (and that is the wall of Gamle Bergen or Old Bergen) turn to the left and you will see the gate. During the season they also have restaurant working. Watch out for the swing on the hill above the small lake, it is not fixed on the rope, so you can easily fell down.",

Bull designed it himself and included so many different types of architecture.  We first gathered for a very informative and interesting discussion of his life.  He really was a man ahead of his time!  I was surprised to learn of his connections to the US and the amount of time he spent here, as well as his \"rock star\" type of popularity in his home country.  A trip here is certainly worth the time!",

Yeah, sensible people would stay indoors on a day like that :), but that offered me the privilege to enjoy the boat driver's kindness and conversation. With Bergen Card the bus rides and the boat ride to the island are free and so is the visit to the villa.\nFew minutes into the trip, the villa revealed itself and it was nothing short of a fairy tale. Beautiful architecture, beautiful setting and breathtaking views. \nThe walking paths on the island, paved with crushed shells, radiate from the house. You can have long walks (unfortunately I couldn't, because of the rain and the late time), but you cannot get lost, as Ole Bull's thought was that his guests should always find their way back to the house, from each and every spot on the island.\nI was fortunate to have amazing Jelena as my \"private\" guide, me being the only English speaking visitor at that particular time. The tour was great, very informative, Jelena told me all the stories and anecdotes of the house, of Ole Bull and his family and of some of the objects and furniture pieces in the house.\nBut what stayed with me above all was the energy of the island (The Island of Light), the energy of the house and Jelena's smile and conversation. It was one of those fate-arranged encounters that leave an ever lasting mark on your soul.",

Since nobody knew how it really looked they modeled it on the Borgund Stavkirke decorating it with a steeple, dragon heads, etc. In 1992 the church burnt to the ground. They reconstructed it without even trying to recreate its medieval appearance while using modern materials and building techniques. So now it looks like it belongs to Disneyland. It's surrounded by a wire fence and if you want to simply get closer to this brand new Disney church, just behind the fence, you must pay 60 NOK right at the gate. Nice. \n \nIf you drive there, there's a small parking lot for buses on the right, but I don't think cars are allowed there. If you drive past it there's a parking lot of some company on the left where I saw some visitors park their cars. You can also try to find a spot on the street leading to the bus parking. From there it's a 5 minute walk thru a nice wooden area.",

First and original stave church was moved from Fortun to Fantoft in 1883. Unfortunately in 1992 was burnt by arson connected with early Norwegian black metal scene. The current form of a stave church in Fantoft we owe to 20th-century architect Egil O. Laastad who designed it and two architects J. L. Andersen and K. H. Irgens who conducted construction works. Its plan, interior and roofs topped with beautifully sculptured dragon-heads were based on decorations of various late Viking Age stave churches from Norway.\n\nIn my opinion, stave church in Fantoft is worth visiting not only due to its architecture, history but also because of its beautiful location.",

Dragons are perched along the roofline, and other Viking icons are carved onto the ends of the pews inside.  It also has a wonderful \"woody\" smell -- like freshly hewn wood -- inside.

The staff was helping with our questions and took US$! We spend a half hour in the church zone surrounded by security and a fence. We walked around the property that surrounded it and saw so much that added to the experience. It’s so beautiful to be there, with the church as the backdrop. Like everything in Norway, it is expensive but I think this is one of those places that most people would appreciate. \nAdded is a picture of my brother standing in front of the 11 century cross.

There’s 2 people sit in front of the door to sell tickets. It was 60/p for a 30 seconds visit. Some people even just walked through without paying which made the feeling, of getting ripped off, worse. Best view and photos are taken from the outside, it’s not worth to get in there by all means.

This church is nestled in the woods with trolls living all around it!  Was disappointed it was fenced in but understand why.  One arson was enough.\n\nPaid the price to go inside and was glad we did!  All the wood carvings were amazing!  Ask about all the dragons.  Legend has it back in the day, dragons were good luck.\n\nThe construction of no nails or screws makes it so unique!",

When in Norway you should see how the Norwegians worshipped years ago.  We felt the trip was very worthwhile.",

There is a cafe up there so you can grab a light bite and  cocktail and enjoy the view. There are also opportunities to hike into the mountains from easy children's hike to challenging trek, if you are so inclined. If visiting Bergen, this is a must see stop.",

So, you waste less time if you buy directly with that person or if you buy at the self-serve machine below the stairs. Don’t forget to pay parking at the other machine outside the building. I read online there were some sort of “telescopes” on top, but when I went (June 23, 2019) they were not there. The views from the top are magnificent. Cable car ride is not long and you never have to wait long for the next one. Definitely recommend the cable car ride to the top.",

The dinner was fabulous, a 4 course meal, with a menu that challenged our boring palates but was thoroughly enjoyable.  Plus the mountain goats gave us a bit of a show while we were waiting for the next course.  It was a bit slow, perhaps because there was a large group at the same time, but everyone was very pleasant and professional and watching the view change as the light changed was amazing.  The only thing that was missing was that there is no shuttle service from the cable-car station back down to the city.  You have to walk down to the main road to catch a city bus.  It was a several minute walk down a somewhat steep hill, so if you are not up to the walk, be prepared to call a taxi.",

The views of Bergen and the wider area from the top are simply superb. We walked one of the (shorter) mountain trails, amazed at how quickly we had gone from a cityscape to true wilderness. The pure air and the smell of heather and fir was so invigorating. Would recommend this trip as a 'must do' for anyone visiting Bergen.",

The shuttle bus left from Bryggen area and took us comfortably to the cable car. There was a short line of people waiting for the cable car, which runs in about every 8-10 minutes. Unfortunately while we were going up it started to rain and basically it was raining during the whole time. Up in the mountain there are very good spots to take pictures + a restaurant (we did not try that). We wanted do to a big hike, however unfortunately after about 30-40 minutes snowy rain started to fall and a cloud totally wrapped the mountain, so we had to come down quite quickly. Nevertheless what we saw was absolutely breathtaking and I am sure that in clearer weather you can easily spend there 2-3 hours.",

However when doing the Vidden trail I found this is the best place to start, and end at Floyen.",

      "text": "On a clear day or even a semi-clear day which is more likely in Bergen, the trip up Mt. Ulriken by cable car is a pleasant way to spend a few hours. The views of the city and harbor are nice, but similar to lots of other such places. If you are a hiker and not just a tourist, the ride would be more rewarding since there are trails leading all over the place. When we were there on a Saturday, we enjoyed seeing the hikers below, often with their dogs and even small children. Norwegians are really into physical fitness and hiking is like a national pastime.\nLet me give you a warning about one thing and that is unless you are absolutely famished and in danger of collapsing, do not buy anything at the little restaurant at the summit. In an expensive country, this was the most ridiculous clip joint of all we encountered. One cup of ordinary coffee was the equivalent of $6.00 and a tiny apple muffin to go with it was another $3.00. Even Norwegians to whom we spoke later were amazed at that bit of thievery.",

When we left the ship, we could easily see the top of the mountain, but the excursion bus took us for a tour of Bergen before we drove to the gondola base.    Perhaps they had an appointment time for our ascent?\n\nBy the time we arrived at the gondola base, the clouds and rain had moved in so we had decent views of the city below as we as rode  up the cable - until we entered the clouds.\n\nAt the top station, we were mostly above the clouds so could see sky above and clouds below.    Luckily the clouds moved quickly and we had intermittent times that we could see the city below, and we took advantage of those seconds to take some great pictures.\n\nNaturally as we boarded the gondola to head back down to the base station, the clouds parted for several minutes of clear skies.  Oh well.\n\nThe gondola ride is comfortable and smooth.    The scenery is good during the ascent and descent. The facilities at the top include a nice cafe, restrooms, a gift shop and several viewing platforms.\n\nThere were some wooly sheep grazing at the top of the mountain that were being filmed by a television crew while we were at the top.   The sheep were interesting but be careful where you step - smile.\n\nWe traveled up with a hiker who was riding to the top to hike the trail back down to the town.   That would be a scenic hike but time and weather did not allow.\n\nA great attraction but do a “do not rain” dance before you drive to the gondola station.",

The steps have just been made by Nepalese sherpas flown over to create expert steps from local rocks. The other option is to take the path Which is longer and apparently less difficult. We took the steps and figured you have to go up no matter what. It was not too bad. We took it easy and the whole thing took under 90 mins including photo stops etc. Take pics as you go because the weather closes in and you might lose the view for a while. The last bit is a bit of a push. There is a railing to hang onto and help pull yourself up the last few steps. Locals take their dogs up this trail every weekend so don't get too freaked out about the level of difficulty. I'm 47 and hauling extra weight and bad knees and it was no problem for me. You earn the hot chocolate and pancakes at the top! Showers available too if you want to take a towel and soap. Cable car every 30 mins down and then walk to get any number of buses back into town.

The weather can change quickly in the mountains so I would recommend checking the weather before heading up. We took public transit to the base of Mount Ulriken.

The hike was well marked in most places. After a while the signs were replaced with stone piles to mark the way. The hike from one mountain to the other is 13 km so make sure you have plenty of food and water. Rain gear and hiking boots are a must! This was the most beautiful, scenic hike! Lots of photo opportunities! Well worth the trek!  Once you get to Fløyen you can take the funicular back down to the town centre. ",

      "text": "Visited Ulriken on Sunday 12th August. Caught the number 12 bus from Bergen and got off at the Haukeland hospital. It costs about £9 for a 24hr bus ticket or you can buy a single on the bus for about £3.50. I don’t know if we went the right way but we walked through the hospital grounds up to the Ulriken 643 cable car. We paid for a one way ticket as we planned to walk back down. We arrived at about 1.15pm which was later than we planned and so the queues were taking a while to go down - we queued for an hour to go up.\nOnce up we queued to buy a sandwich and got to the front of the queue the cafe ran out of bread! We had a bun instead (sandwiches were £11 each but did look good and prices in Norway are much more than in the UK).\nWe decided to do a walk around the lakes at the top of Ulriken - the green walks are easy and up to about 4.3km in length. We soon lost the route and were making our own walk up with no real idea of where we were going. It was busy though and we never went so far that we were actually lost. It did take us 2 hours to do what we planned as a one hour walk. There were no maps available for us to take on the walk with us and all we had was a photo on my phone that we took of a map on a display board. The signposting was inadequate if you actually want to follow a route. The ground is wet and rocky in places and very uneven and rocky in others - you need water proof shoes really.\nThe walk down is much longer and much more strenuous than expected. The walk up would have been more than we could have done and we are both averagely fit adults with no health problems. I would have paid for the return cable car trip if I had known what to expect. Some people coming up had small children with them - I really don’t know if these children would have found the walk all the way up enjoyable. At the top the stairs virtually disappear and there is a rail to hold onto to help pull yourself up over the remaining rocks.\nWe did not get back to the bottom of Ulriken until almost 7pm, 6 hours after we arrived so much longer than we had planned. We were really tired at the end of the day but the views were worth it and if we had allowed more time we could have done everything at a more leisurely pace!",

You absolutely need outdoor shoes, because the way contains wet parts and there are a lot of stones. I think having outdoor shoes is also more important if you’re planing to go the shorter way down again. The legs may be wobbly because of the way up and the loose stones on the way make it not even better. I’ve went the shorter way up (it’s about 1 1/2 hour, 2-2 1/2 if you want to enjoy the landscape and take some pictures) and the shorter way down. I’ve met some people telling me about the longer way, it’s about 2 -3 hours up but it sounds easier. I think everyone has to decide which way is the best, I saw children going the harder way so easily but I also saw fit men huffing and puffing in the middle of the way. No matter which way you go up, it’s absolutely worth it! The view is incredible. On the top is a bistro and a kiosk where you can buy you some food or sit on a platform with a coffee before the way down. Inside the bistro are toilets were you also have the opportunity to fill your water bottle. \nOf course you have the opportunity to skip the way up and down and just take the Ulrikenban. A ticket for the way up and down was about 175nok (adult) and 125nok (children)! A important information may be that your only able to pay by visa or \nMasterCard at the ticket machine. Someone told me it’s also possible to get a ticket at the gondola, but I’m not sure, if it really works. \nIf you want to avoid a long waiting period and you’re planing to take the gondola, start your trip early in the morning. \n\nIf you want to go by public transport from Bergen you have to take the bus number 2 to Birkelundstoppen at the Strandkaiterminalen (it’s the destination next to the tourist information) and leave the bus at Haukeland sjukehus before the tunnel. It’s about a 10 Minute walk to the starting point of Ulriken. ",

Many of the scenic waterfront structures are from this era. We took the walking tours with a student guide and he did an excellent job of painting a picture of the lives of the merchants, who were primarily young apprentices. The tour gave us a great understanding of an important time in the history of Northern Europe. Much of Bergen has gone \"tourist\" with more focus on shopping, dining and entertainment, and many historical sites are closed, but this museum is a bright beacon of city history not to be missed.",

  "description": "etween 1850 and 1900 Bergen had three hospitals for leprosy patients and the largest concentration of patients in Europe. The city’s oldest leprosy hospital, St. George’s Hospital, is now not only a monument to thousands of personal tragedies, it is also an important arena for the dissemination of Norwegian work and research on leprosy. In many parts of the world leprosy is commonly known as Hansen’s disease, after the Norwegian physician Gerhard Armauer Hansen who discovered the leprosy bacillus in Bergen in 1873. The herb garden we meet today is from the 1990s. It is open to the Public during museum opening hours. Open mid may - end august daily from 11 until 15",

If you have the slightest interest in history, medicine, science or even social history, you would be interested in this place.  It's well laid out, not large with good written booklet in English and plenty of gory drawings to illustrate the leprosy victims.  The hospital church was opened for about 10 minutes while we were there (it opens every hour for about 10 minutes) and a short commentary in English was given - really interesting.  It won't take you more than an hour and they will organise an English tour guide to take you around if you ask - an extra fee is payable for this of course!",

Take the tour because your guide will provide much more detail than you'll get from reading the signage on the exhibits. ",

I don't know how many tours they do a day, but ours started at 12 noon.\n\nAdmission was free with our Bergen card. The tour costs NOK20.\n\nWith the tour which ended with viewing the inside of the wooden church, a real gem, took about 1:15 hours. The church was opened for 10 minutes at 12:50.

It was a seamless transfer via 75 minute coach bus ride from Bergen bus station to the town of Nordheimsund for the ferry/cruise portion to the town of Eidfjord and back (with several other stops along the way). We had several hours to explore Eidfjord and surrounding area on foot before returning to the boat, otherwise there was also an optional bus tour of the area you could add on for additional cost. \n\nWe thoroughly enjoyed our day exploring the scenery of the Hardanger fjord and the town of Eidfjord. We were traveling with our baby and were pleasantly surprised that the coach bus from Bergen had a built-in car seat and the boat had large table/booths reserved for families with small children and baby changing facilities in the bathroom on board. We made sure to book this cruise on a day with good weather forecast, which I would recommend is a must if possible to get the full enjoyment of the scenery. ",

Numerous springs going down the slopes, numerous waterfalls along the road or along the fjord, and it seems every little settlement has its own waterfall. Internet say 40% of some sort of fruits in Norway comes from this area (like apples, pears, plums) and you can find local produces in these little towns.

      "text": "This is a review of the Hardangerfjord Cruise round trip from Norheimsund with bus roundtrip from Bergen. The bus ride was nice but the highlight was of course the cruise. It was a very rainy day with very short breaks of sun and despite this, it was an exhilarating experience being outside on the upper deck for as long as you could stand being pelted by rain. The clouds in the mountains actually added to the great pictures and videos. The difference between seeing the views through the window and standing on the deck is like the difference between being at a sporting event in a stadium and watching the same exact event on TV. So, make the effort and go up on the deck, even if you initially don’t feel like it. WARNING: Several people fell on the slippery narrow stairs up to the deck and one woman had major pain and crying. Use both rails at the same time to avoid injury, especially kids! As with all fjords, the narrower ones are more impressive. Be outside on deck for these and pay attention to details on land such as boat houses, farms, isolated houses, literally thousands of waterfalls. We saw two rainbows. Eidfjord has absolutely gorgeous surroundings. The boat has a 2 hr 45 min layover there. Bring change 10 Kr for public bathrooms. Ulvik very beautiful. Many charming stops along the route. Views are MUCH better than the Express Boat from Bergen to Balestrand (Flam). Bring food with you for this 11.5 hour day trip from Bergen. Boat had two bathrooms, only one had toilet paper. Not a big deal for some of us. Our primary goal for this trip was to experience fjords. The Hardangerfjord cruise definitely met this goal. We are now starting 3 nights in Balestrand and intend to experience more fjords differently.",

      "text": "We did DIY from Bergen-Norheimsund(Bus)-Eidfjord(Cruise)-Voringsfossen(local tour)-Voss(Bus)-Bergen(train). It was about 11`12 hours and it was cheaper if you DIY instead of purchasing the package from web site. There are tour companies providing similar trips with tour guide but they are more expensive.\nDuring the trip, you spent most of time on bus/cruise/train, you got about 3 hours at Eidfjord and we chose to attend the local tour to visit the Voringsfossen (waterfall) and Hardangervidda Nature center. The waterfall was smaller than what we had seen from Youtube and the Nature center was an interesting place.\nThe view of Hardanger Fjord from cruise (2:45) was beautiful but not as magnificent as Sognefjord or Nærøyfjord. If you plan to spend two days at Bergen, this is a good choice.",

She suggested the Norwegian Fisheries Museum. While one can take a bus, we opted to walk and had a very scenic half hour stroll to get to the museum. While it appears to be the perfect place for class trips and is somewhat geared to the younger set, it was nonetheless an excellently done museum. It is set in historic wharf warehouse buildings but the exhibits are about as modern as can be as to technology, interactive displays and other media. There are a lot of hands-on exhibits. And there is what turned out to be a lot of interesting information about the backbone industry of Norway from both an historic perspective and a future-looking sustainability perspective. We ended up spending a couple of hours here. It also has a very cozy cafe serving yummy food and with nice views onto the water.",

We were intending to go anyway but were delighted to be told when visiting the Hanseatic House that they were promoting the fishing museum so they handed us free tickets. There is also a free shuttle bus between the two museums which runs every half hour.\n\nJudging by the sparse attendance in August this is clearly an under-appreciated facility.\n\nIt is spread over several floors  in two buildings and although there is a recommended route visitors are encouraged to wander at will. The rotes to the various sections are indicated by different coloured fish on the floor.\n\nI would particularly urge you to watch the eighteen minute film on the first floor about fishing. Three generations discuss their love of this way of life. Sadly at the end they conclude that boats have got bigger and more expensive and that even if the young man were to get the money for a boat he could not afford the exorbitant cost of a quota. Their island faces depopulation as inhabitants are no longer able to fish.\n\nIn contrast I would suggest you skip the film on sealing, especially if you have children. Some of the scenes depicted are not pleasant.\n\nThe whole museum is very child friendly and nowhere more so than on the top floor where children’s photos are taken and their avatars are projected onto the picture of a town where they then have to interact with the display.\n\nI will conclude with a small plug for the cafe with it’s home baked bread and charming atmosphere.\n",

Although it isn't in center city Bergen, the museum is only a couple of stops from the Fish Market on one of a number of city buses. We originally planned to take the free ferry that departs from the Fish Market. But the ferry never arrived and we later learned that when the waters are rough, the ferry doesn't run. A sign would have been nice. So, if the harbor waters seem choppy, just get the bus. The museum's website clearly indicates which buses run to the museum.\nAt any rate, once we figured out that the ferry wasn't running, we decided to take the bus from Bryggen and we got off at Sandvikstorget. (The bus driver also pointed out the museum for us.)  If you get a Bergen Tourist Card, travel on buses and the tram is free as is entrance into the museum. \nThe museum is located in an old fishing warehouse and takes you through the history of fishing from Bergen. I found the exhibits on fish farms and the history of seal hunting to be particularly interesting. And, the video interviews of fishermen from three generations was particularly entertaining, especially their discussions of seasickness! The museum also includes a lovely cafe in which you can have a cup of coffee or tea while overlooking the harbor.",

Male penguins sometimes adopt eggs and become the world's best \"mothers\", some turtles can breathe through their backsides, the plastic we throw away every year creates a sheet in the ocean as big as some countries, and spiders use hydraulics to move: after a visit to the aquarium, you'll definitely know something you didn't beforehand. And you'll know it with your entire body - not just your head. At Bergen Aquarium, children and adults alike can see, touch, read about and follow the animals and aquarium keepers at close range. You can watch shows and feedings, and see how fish and animals act when in their element. Bergen Aquarium has been a must-see institution for visitors and residents alike since 1960. It's situated a short way from the centre of Bergen, in a fantastic parkside location with a view out over the seaward approach to Bergen from all sides. There's good food, too: Biologen Akvariet is a brasserie offering proper food made with proper ingredients. It'll give you energy for the whole visit, and then some.",

The admission price wasn’t too bad for Norway about £75 for a family ticket. We got there for about 1030 hrs and stayed until 1600 hrs so definitely value for money. The restaurant was good but would have liked fresh Sausage to be made fresh rather than the buffet style. However all in all a real must visit especially for the kids. ",

They've done a great job of explaining all the fish they have in the context of Norway's different waterways (fjords, sea, rivers etc) and it offers a far better experience than any of the UK aquariums in my opinion.  There were some lizards and crocodiles too.  Avoid the cafe - overpriced and manned by surly teenagers with poor customer service. Other than that, well worth a visit!",

The rest of the aquarium was as you'd expect from a small city -although the crocidiles were a surprise and the penguins were fun. Good little shop there too.

You will be fascinated even at the doorstep of Bergen Aquarium (Akvariet i Bergen) when you met the Gentoo penguins. \nThose charismatic waddlers, who are near threatened (IUCN Red List), are great examples of parenting. If they find their right partners, the two Gentoo penguins will have lifelong bonds (as what I've learned from the aquarium display board), and are highly nurturing. At breeding time, the two parents work to build a nest out of stones, grass, moss, and feathers; the mother then deposits two eggs, which both parents take turns incubating for more than a month. That's real good role models for us to learn from.\nBy the way, remember to check the penguin feeding time, usually 11am and 2pm (for which you can confirm on their website before the trip).",

There was a small sitting area where we were offered water and tea for free, complete with restrooms.   What a lovely gesture for us tourists!  Behind this area, with a short uphill walk, is a lovely panoramic view of the surroundings.  \n\nOnce out of the port, make a right towards the City Centre.  Surely can't be missed as there are sight-seeing buses parked there.  There is also a sign post, which says: \"Sentrum,\" meaning downtown.  When you get to the fork in the road, keep to the left to head toward the Fortress. \n\n Keep to the right if you wish to head toward the Fish Market.  Once at the fish market, look to the left and walk up the street between the two big buildings on the corner and this will take you to the Floibanen Funicular. One building has the name:  \"Ann Madam.\"   Most attractions are within walking distance. Lots of restaurants and historical buildings around the old part of the city...wonderful ambience.",

The fortress itself is pretty with a number of historic buildings.  It was nice to wander around and check the place out.\n\nThat being said, there wasn't much to see.  Most of the buildings were not open to visitors, and construction closed many places that would be fun to see such as the Rosenkrantz Tower.  There was also some kind of carnival going on, which may have impacted the operating status of buildings.\n\nSo if you are in to visiting old fortresses or there is some event going on, Bergenhus could be a reasonable place to visit.

The Hall and Tower date from the 13th century and are interesting, if somewhat expensive, visits. ",

Currently the Rosenkrantz Tower is covered with plastic for maintenance and as a result you can’t get up on the roof. The Haakon Hall was amazing considering its age though some of the renovations inside have too much of a 1950s feel to give you a sense of the medieval heritage of the castle. The parkland area outside was very bare and cold the day we visited. Staff were all extremely friendly and well informed.",

But his paintings and prints are loved and instantly recognized by many Norwegians. The display (in 2019) is aptly named \"out of the shadow\", I guess this refers to Edvard Munch's shadow. Astup has been called \"Norway's other great painter\" (Munch is of course #1). Also an excellent collection from the Norwegian romantic period and ancient furniture donated by Rasmus Meyer. One ticket covers all buildings and visitors must step outside to transfer.One of the buildings is a cool functionalist buildings previously home to the electricity supply in Bergen",

It featured Norwegian painters, including Munch, and had a very nice collection of portraits, landscapes and more modern paintings.  It was quiet and well-lit and thus very easy to concentrate and focus on the art.  I had never heard of any painter except Munch, and I couldn't understand why - the quality was outstanding. I surmised that perhaps stylistically none of them were groundbreaking, but still, they were beautifully and skillfully done.  If you're in Bergen and you like art museums, go here.  \n\nThe more modern museum had an installation of various configurations of large painted pipes.  Not my cup of tea, but OK.\n\nThere was also a fascinating silver exhibit with every type of silver tool, cutlery, dish, pot, bowl or whatever you could think of, all beautifully displayed in a large room.",

In every building are presented different exhibitions concerning art. \n\nIn KODE 3 are beautifully exhibited artworks from the Golden Age of Norwegian art. In this gallery are presented inter alia paintings of Edvard Munch, J.C. Dahl and Theodor Kittelsen. \n\nExhibitions presented in KODE 4 give the opportunity to see how art is changed from the 14th century to modern times. In this gallery, we can not only admire wonderful paintings of Norwegian masters but also see works of artists from abroad (e.g. Pablo Picasso).\n\nTo conclude, visit in KODE is the perfect opportunity to admire and learn more about Norwegian art. This wonderful travel through the history of art is possible at a cost of one ticket (to all four galleries). KODE 3 and KODE 4 are definitely worth seing during a visit in Bergen!",

Galleries like this are not just for rainy days (of which Bergen gets many) but for enjoyment as a destination in themselves.  There was so much to see and the one ticket takes you in all of them.  The silver collection was stunning and brilliantly displayed and is worth spending time with to appreciate the silversmiths art.  The Singer collection is also impressive, I was unaware of the Norway connection.\n\nFor many the highlight will be the Munch paintings, so much more to him than \"The Scream\" with his changing styles over the years.  There are also some absolutely wonderful troll pictures by Kittelsen.  The landscape paintings by JC Dahl were so impressive and a boat journey the following day to Flam put those into perspective and the deservedly popular artist Astrup is well represented .  There is so much more besides through all four galleries including a good collection of twentieth century European art.",

The Dahl show shouldn't be missed either as his work was important to the forging of a distinct Norwegian identity.  Some of Dahl's canvases are vast depictions of Norwegian landscapes. There's a surprisingly good collection of twentieth century art with quite a few Picassos thanks to an enlightened early acquisition policy.  \n\nEach building has a different character and some have more to see than others.  KODE 2 has a good bookshop and a cafe which has delicious scones.",

      "title": "A very enjoyable visit!",
      "text": "We wanted to visit the Edvard Grieg house and museum while in Bergen but heard that it's not easy to get to.  We were glad to see that we could purchase a package tour from the TI.  The package included a bus ride to Troldhaugen, departing at 11:00 a.m. from the TI near Bergen's harbor. Then at 11:30 there would be a  guided tour of the house. This would be followed by a 30 minute concert. Then there would be free time to visit the museum and stroll the grounds and/or get a bite of lunch (cost not included) in the cafe.  We'd be transported by bus back to Bergen, arriving at 2:25 p.m.  It sounded like a perfect way to spend 3.5 hours.  I tried to book 2 tickets online but my credit card wasn't going through so we decided to just go buy the tickets in person at the TI.  We got there at 10:15 a.m. and had to take a number to be served, so it was 10:30 by the time we got to the desk. Unfortunately, they said that the excursion was sold out for that day. I asked if we would still be able to do the guided house tour and concert if we got out there on our own, i.e., was it just the bus that was sold out? The answer was yes, it was only the bus ride that we couldn't book. Then the helpful person at the TI instructed us on how to take the tram out to the edge  of town, and how to walk from the tram stop to the Grieg property. He warned that it was a 20 minute tram ride and a 20 to 30 minute walk, and the only guided tour of the house each day was at 11:30, so we'd have to get going, and walk briskly, in order to not miss the tour.  He could have sold us tickets for the house tour but suggested we not buy them until we were there. That way, if we arrived too late, we wouldn't have wasted the money on the tickets.  We had a bit of trouble finding the tram station, then just missed one tram and had to wait 7 minutes for another, so that by the time we got off the tram and started the 20 to 30 minute walk, it was already 11:10. We were sure we'd miss the tour. However, that day's tour was running late and we got there on time!  The tour started at 11:45.  A big group was convened for this tour.  They'd come off of a couple of tour buses.  Two guides divided the big group into subgroups of about 30 to 35 people each, so there were actually two guided tours, spaced about 5 minutes apart.  As a result of all of this, it was a little hard to appreciate the beauty of the home.  The rooms, of course, had ropes to mark off the areas where tourists weren't supposed to go. With 30 to 35 people congregated behind those ropes, it was crowded. However, our guide did a great job of telling us interesting information about the family and the home. We had no trouble hearing him and the information was very nicely presented.  The house tour lasted only about 25 minutes, and then it was time to move into the concert hall for our concert, scheduled to start at 12:15.  We enjoyed the concert so much!  The pianist was very, very talented. It was a treat to listen to the Grieg compositions while gazing out of the window, at the back of the stage, onto the composing hut where the music was written.  A beautiful design.  After the concert, we spent time roaming the grounds, walking down the heavily wooded path from the house to the composing hut, admiring the fjord view from there. We saw the crypt where the ashes of Edvard and his wife, Nina, are entombed. We admired the garden. We spent a lot of time in the museum reading more about the lives of Edvard and Nina, and thought that the museum was very well done. The cafe is beautiful, with a wall of windows over the fjord, but we didn't order any food in there. After our visit, we took our time strolling back to the tram stop, in comparison to the brisk pace we'd used to not miss the house tour. It was fun to see what the outskirts of Bergen look like, the residential neighborhoods outside of the touristy city center. We loved our time at the Grieg home and museum!  I wish the house tour had been a little less crowded.  It would be nice if they would offer it at regular intervals throughout the day instead of just one time each day.",

The bus ride to the site was 20M, the host providing some commentary on Grieg and pointing out other touristic matters along the way. After getting our ticket, we toured Troldhaugen, the Grieg home. Two or the rooms have original pieces. The concert was next, lasting some 25M, pieces by Grieg naturally featured. Thereafter there was time to look inside his little hut where he did his composing. A walk down to the original grave site was followed by time at the museum. There was a restaurant on site if you wanted a little something to eat. The return trip was at 1400. The price including transportation was 290 krones. Full value was received.",

Sound, artistry, technique and interpretation was just completely amazing by this norwegian-russian-asian woman. Cool mix. Interesting to experience this level so far away. Speechless. Will tell my friends in Melbourne about this. Grieg's place was interesting. His grandfather came from Scotland, I learn new stuff every day here. Bergen is these days filled up with old tall ships racing around. We are happy also because of that. Norway is a bit similar to New Zealand except crazy prices of beer.",

We got there on our own, taking the tram (about 20 min) then walking almost 30 minutes To get to the house.  Once there, aside from the house itself, we had a frustrating time.  The display of photographs and written panels of text seems like a lousy way to present someone’s life (especially tiring to stand and read your way through his history after the long walk).  We were encouraged by the staff to watch the film in the small theater — but this is also disappointing, not anything about his life, just pretty pictures of Norway with his music as background.   There was a concert — but we were shut out of it, as it was private for Viking tour group members.  (We would gladly have paid to occupy one of the many empty seats, but this was not an option.)  nothing for it but to spend another 30 minutes to trudge back to the tram stop, then stand on a crowded tram the 20 minutes or so it took to get back to Bergen.  \n\nA bus tour organized through the TI would have been a much better option!

The house itself is an interesting period property, and the detail we were given inside added to the enjoyment. I certainly wouldn’t put anyone off seeing it. Outside there were lovely views. And you could understand why they had chosen to build a property there, and how the ambience would have aided his composing.\n\nPart of the trip included a 30 minute piano recital in the adjoining concert hall. Apparently, various Norwegian pianists receive an invitation to perform this duty just for a week, and they are then given a free rein as to which of Greig’s compositions to include in their recital. I think our pianist forgot that he wasn’t playing to an audience of experts but to an audience of tourists. Many of us would recognise and enjoy Grieg’s best known pieces, but he chose to ignore all of those, and instead to fill his 30 minutes with some very obscure and (dare I say) boring compositions with his own arrangements. Such a shame. Looking around the audience I noted more than one dozing off\n\nSo, I would award 4 stars to the house but (in the week I went) only 1 star to the piano recital",

The tour guide who showed us around the house was friendly and informative and we learnt so much about Grieg, his life and his works. We then had some spare time to explore the garden, his writing hut and visit the small museum and café before attending the 30 minute piano recital in the beautiful little concert hall which was the highlight of the trip. You really feel how this lovely villa and the perfect location on the lake was such an inspiration to him.",

Aside from that, being able to see his house and many family photos and decorations was a unique experience. The guide knew a lot about Grieg, his family and his music. There was ample free time to visit the museum and walk the grounds (to see his \"composing hut\" and his gravesite) before the 1pm concert started. The pianist we saw was exceptional and the acoustics (and views) from the concert hall were excellent. I enjoyed this very much and would not hesitate to return if I ever go back to Bergen.",

      "text": "We visited the Bergen Tourist Information Office, and one of the tours they offered was a tour & concert at Troldhaugen, the home of Edvard & Nina Grieg.  My childhood was full of music by Grieg thanks to my mother, who loved the composer and ensured most of her piano students played his pieces, so this was a trip with great significance for me.  \nWe met our bus and tour guide outside the Tourist Information office; our tour guide was well-informed and entertaining, offering lots of great information about Grieg, his friend Ole Bull, and the 19th century Norwegian musical community \nIf you take this tour, be prepared to walk about ¼ mile from bus parking to the Grieg homestead.  On arrival, we split into two groups – one to stay in the performance center/museum and the other to tour the Grieg home.\nThe home, built in 1885 with great input from both Edvard and Nina Grieg, was planned to be a museum even before Grieg and his wife died.  It opened as a museum in 1928, ad now features a concert hall, the home (called a Villa), and the Grieg’s tomb, near the water below the home.\nOnly the main floor is open to the public, and includes a room filled with items of great significance to the Grieg family, the dining room, a living room which features the piano Grieg used during his life, and is still used for concerts.  According to our guide the guide, the furnishings throughout the house were either original to the house, or accurate to the period of use.  There is also an enclosed porch which Nina Grieg converted into a conservatory, and which features a beautiful stained glass rose over the door.\nThe Griegs were great entertainers, and their home was often filled with guests.  Frustrated by the lack of peace and quiet due to those visitors, Grieg had a small cabin constructed near to the water, and where we were told he composed some of his most famous musical compositions.\nA short (but rather rain-slicked) walk down the hill from the Villa, Edvard and Nina Grieg share their eternal rest behind a tombstone in the hillside that bears the inscription of their name.  Here Grieg rests in the Norwegian woods he loved so much and wrote of so often.\nIn 1985, a beautiful concert hall was built especially for the performance of chamber music.  The picture window behind the stage area is the perfect frame for Grieg’s cabin and the water behind it.  The hall has seating for 200 people.  We were privileged to enjoy a lunch-time concert featuring pianist Martha Berit Belt.  Her performance of several Grieg compositions was breath-taking, and a perfect end to our tour of Troldhaugen.\nFor Grieg fans, this tour is a must when in Bergen; but even non-Grieg fans will enjoy and appreciate the history which has been so carefully curated.\n ",

Think about stepping into a composer's own home and fell like he is there. What an unforgettable experience.   \nI was pretty lucky visiting there on a sunny day in September that I didn't walk on the slippery paths. But I think I still will be be appreciated the views even on a raining day. Besides, Bergen got it's fame as a rainy city. Also Grieg loved to take strolls during raining days in his property.",

Our actual concert was in the Troldhaugen home of Grieg, due to the international piano contest, and the setting was so intimate that you felt like it was in your own home. Both the Tenor and the Pianist were outstanding! While I was disappointed not to be able to be in the actual concert hall, with it's view of the composing hut and lake, how often do you get to sit less than three feet away from an internationally known pianist and watch her hands massage the keys? My only constructive criticism is that - and again this may be due to the contest - the visit seemed disorganized and with long waiting spells. But, worth the wait. ",

We asked what the boat was called, only to be informed that it didn’t have a name. We asked how we were supposed to know that we were on the correct boat if it didn’t have a name – we were given a print out with a picture on and told “that’s the picture of the boat”.  We were informed that the pick-up point was “about a 15 minute walk away, just past the church”.\n\nOnce the trip was over (we only had 1½ hours when we were told it was 2 hours), we walked round the harbour and noticed the hop-on/hop-off boats which were only NOK 100 £10 per person.  Needless to say, we were furious!  \n\nIf you should visit Tourist Information in Bergen and they try to fob you off into paying a lot of money for going on a boat, please be aware that you can do the hop-on/hop-off boat tours for a lot less money – and probably more enjoyable!",

Also, check for everything you want to see, as they won't tell you what isn't open (e.g. because it's being refurbished) and you can't rely on museum's websites to be honest about it either. However, if you ask the right questions, the staff will politley give you the correct information.",

After asking us what we like, l find her very patient, helpful and honest to tourist like us telling us to pay for the individual attractions rather than getting a Bergen card which would be more expensive.

      "text": "We have been there three times during our month in Norway.  The employees are always nice but only one was truly helpful and knowledgeable.  She recommended some great road trips.  To be honest though, driving in Norway this time of year, \nOctober, takes much more time than the GPS says it will.  We turned the \"day trips\" into two night stays.  We stopped a lot to take photos and to enjoy the scenery.  We were stopped several times for road maintenance due to the unusually heavy rains, and had to take alternate routes multiple times due to road closings and early snows.  We had snow tires but local people warned us against travelling on some of the mountain roads.\n\nWe bought a 48 hour Bergen card so we could take the bus for a change.  The woman at the tourist office circled some places on the map and made it sound like they were easy to find.  They were not.  The bus system isn't that easy to navigate.  We had to ask several locals and use the GPS on our phone to find them.  It was easier to walk than to take the bus in many instances.  Most of the drivers speak very little, if any, English.  A local person said the Grieg Museum was much easier to get to by car than by bus.  The Science Museum was hard to find but we did find it with the help of two very nice employees in a sporting goods store.  The only reason we were able to navigate the trip back and forth to where are staying in a cottage near the Sotra Bridge is because we got to know the area well on foot and by car before taking the bus.  It isn't that obvious.  We had an easier time in Costa Rica where the bus stops are not even marked, mostly because we speak some Spanish and are fluent in French.  We speak some German, which is a huge help when deciphering Norwegian but, next time, we will study. Norwegian before we leave.  We should have at least learned how to correctly pronounce the names of the places we planned to visit.\n\nTrip Advisor was at least as much help as the tourist office.  Some of the local experts give great advice and one even sent us a private message with a great recommendation for a day trip to Radoy from Bergen.  It was truly a doable day trip with ample time left over to take some long walks and even to stop at IKEA on the way home.  Norway is beautiful and the people are very nice but travelling can be a bit of a challenge and also very expensive with all of the tolls, ferries, narrow roads, weather, and a bus system that is fabulous only if you speak Norwegian and are also very familiar with the geography.  I don't think the people in the tourist office understand what it is like to be a tourist here.",

Though the second largest city in Norway, this picturesque jewel can easily be traversed in a few hours. There are some very ince parks, shops, galleries, old churches, the Hanseatic Port area to be explored. Architecture is very nice, and all with a nautical flair that reminds me of a small, Hanseatic San Francisco. We just loved the place, despite our limited, cruise stop time line. There are a number of great museums we didnt see, but we went in a couple old churches, shopped, rested in parks and on picturesque hilltops, and had a great lobster with salad in the Hanseatic port. If youve got some shoe leather to spare to burn off all those cruise ship buffet calories, just WALK Bergen. It was a blast.",

I went to the similar location in Oslo ... they were set up the same and just as slow and I later discovered gave me the WRONG TICKETS for what I'd bought ..... I'd questioned b4 I left and they said \"trust me\" ... I did and got hassled at everyplace I tried to use my City Pass",

The TI then told us the boat crew was new and they didn’t need our names. They refunded our 7000 kroners (now worth $832) and gave us Bergen cards for the day. Don’t really know who or what caused the mix up but there was nothing we could do. Several other people had the same experience that morning. \nThe TI was very crowded on the afternoon of Thursday, Aug 9 when we picked up our tickets. Took an hour for our number to be called.

Many attractions, restaurants etc in close proximity with lots going on, even protests, on the day we were there; however, a lovely place to spend the day.  The Floibanen, Funicular Railway, is located ahead of the fish market, a few minutes walk.  This railway takes you up to Floyen mountain where you can enjoy the spectacular views of the port/city.  Oh, there are numerous goats residing up there.   \n\nTo get to the market place from the cruise ship port, exist the port, take a right towards the City Centre. You will see all the sightseeing buses along here and  a sign post saying:  \"Sentrum,\" which in Norwegian means downtown.  Pass the buses and when you get to a fork in the road, stay to the right.  If you go to the left you will be heading towards Bergenhus Fortress area.  You will be walking along the coast Once at the corner, on your right will be the fish market and if you go left you will be headed towards the Funicular. To get there, walk up the street between the two buildings on the corner. The one on the right says: \"Ann Madam.\" This is indeed a very beautiful area.",

Whale meat, as it turns out, have the looks, texture and taste more like beef than any fish meat I’ve ever seen. It can be quite tough, and tender if cooked “medium well” (I think. It’s pink in the middle!).\n\nAnyway, it’s quite an experience, and Bergen rains a lot, so if you don’t want to get wet, choose the middle section of the tent.",

If you want some shrimp and a 2 inch section of crab leg it’s over $50. Stay away is all I can say. Also, the place is absolutely filthy.

The nice man who worked there remembered me (I had stopped by late the day before, when they had already finished that day's paella) and I was very happy to return the next day. It was quite expensive but every bite was delicious. There were many venues there and if you like fish, or even not, there's something for nearly everyone. My opinion is that if you can afford it, it doesn't hurt to splurge once in a while for some extremely tasty food, so that is what I did. It's fun to walk around the market and the restaurants right nearby and see the variety and smell all the tasty smells.",

A local we met on our Hurtigruten voyage, where we had wonderful seafood, said that, when she was young, her mother could buy fresh fish from a local fish market or directly from a fisherman, but now, all of the fish in Norway is pre-packaged , except for this one market.  If you want fresh fish, your best option is to either buy it here or eat it in a restaurant.  You will pay a lot but it will definitely be delicious.   We didn't actually buy anything at this market, as much as we wanted to, only because of the prices and because we visited this market toward the end of our trip.  We had already had some wonderful seafood meals both on the Hurtigruten Ship and in some nice restaurants in Norway.  We are from the coast of Maine where fresh fish is available everywhere and is also affordable so we had the luxury of knowing we could get all we wanted at home.",

There were 8 of us prepared for this tasting event and thought we might order one live king crab from the tank and just share.  When we inquired about the cost of a king crab with an average weight of about 7 pounds, we were given the cost in Norwegian krones.  When we converted the price to U.S. dollars, we thought there must be some mistake either in what we heard or our monetary converter.  So we decided to ask the waiter to tell us how much the crab would cost in U.S. dollars.  After a quick calculation, the waiter told us that the crab ONLY cost U.S. $650.  Wow, only cost $650.  We estimated that if we ordered some beverages, bread and clam chowder plus the tips, it would cost each of us about U.S. $100 just to try a piece of live king crab.  You guess it, we decided to skip the live king crab and just ordered sampling dishes of probably frozen king crab legs.  That plus the drinks and bread, the damage was a reasonable $30+ per person....",

We walked through the fish market and the seafood did not appear to be or smell very fresh.  It did not appear to be \"the fresh catch of the day right off the boat\". Also, the people are a little aggressive trying to sell their items and they make it difficult to buy from multiple vendors since they said you could only sit in their seating area if you buy from them. And it is ridiculously more expensive to sit there and eat than to get the food to-go.  If we are ever in Bergen again and the seafood actually seems fresh, I would order to go and then sit by the harbor or by the lake to eat. Or I'd probably just go to a nice sit-down restaurant and have a nicer meal with less ambiance.",

We were here at the end of the season so it was not as crowded with tourists, I can only imagine what a nightmare it would be with all the ships in port.  While people complain about how \"overpriced\" the fish is...I haven't seen a restaurant in the 8 days we've been in Norway that wasn't expensive.  Unfortunately for the locals, this must be frustrating to have your traditions overrun with curiosity, for that I am sorry.  As for the market, we ate in the outdoor tents, our guide said \"you will pay a lot for the indoors market\", that area felt like just another restaurant.  Outdoors you hear the fish mongers competing for sales, the bustle of the city, and the smells of the cooking fish, and if the wind is just wrong the smell of fresh fish...stay outdoors...it's covered to protect from sun and rain and they have heaters when it's cold what's not to love!",

It's not possible to miss the Fish Market if you're on your way to visit the Wharf.\n\nThis place is nothing short of touristy - from the Chinese and Japanese signboards, to the Spanish-speaking staff - it is quite evident that this place caters to the many tourists who visit Bergen on a daily basis. \n\nWe chose a shop that was closer to the side of the Bergen Visitor Centre. We ordered 3 pieces of fish - halibut and salmon - fries, vegetables and a salad. As you would expect, food isn't cheap and our meal came up to about US$60. The food wasn't bad, but neither was it memorable - it was average.\n\nThere are many other seafood restaurants scattered around Bergen that offer a more cosy dining experience, with better prices.",

There are places to buy fresh fish and seafood, places to grab a seafood meal, food stands where you can get a grab-n-go meal as well. \nThis is a bustling place, with many locals and tourists checking it out and shopping. \nI had one goal when visiting Norway, and that was to try Reindeer – and unfortunately every stop we made, we did not eat due to timing. However at the fish market I hound a food stand making reindeer sausages, and burgers – which I finally got around to enjoying. \n\nThis would be a great place for locals to get fresh fish for dinner, and it is definitely a great place for tourists to enjoy a small meal. \n\nIt is part authentic fresh fish market for the locals, but it is also part touristy destination - and with all of the trappings that entails. \n\nThere are some stands selling other items that are not as easily perishable as fresh fish – such as brown cheeses, canned herring and other fish, gifts, and much more. \n\nThe prices are reasonable, but I always have to finish that off with “for Norway”. \n\nEnjoy your visit to Bergen, and do not miss out on a visit to the Fish Market. \nIt may not be amazing, but it is a nice place to visit.",

Not sure about that, but their “processing” certainly renders them “mushy” as opposed to the desired “pop”!",

      "text": "The cost of food throughout Scandinavia is expensive.  By accident,  a casual hotel restaurant just across the water from Bryggen had as an appetizer mussels for about $12.00 (USD) and I ordered them in they came in a soup tureen size bowl and the best I’ve ever had (a bit better than the Green Lipped Mussels in New Zealand) !!!!!  So for 3 meals my husband and I had mussels and fresh baked crispy bread and a salad and it was wonderful.  All the fish in Bergen is amazing!",

Wonderful fresh crabs, prawns, lobster and smoked salmon. I’d never seen smoked salmon being calved before, the guys were skilled and kept eating the salmon as they cut it. \n\nThis is a very touristy area and the prices are crazy high (not unlike a lot of Norway) so we didn’t buy anything but it was fun to walk through.

Anyway we went with the flow and ordered one crab leg and one sea urchin. Payed 550 kronor for the crab leg and 100 for the urchin. By the way, don’t waste your money on urchin at this place. The urchin tasted weird and had nothing to compete with the urchin we had in Japan before. ",

The fish stands are extremely high quality and have amazing selection of seafood, especially smoked salmon, whale and cod. You can also find prepared meals here (ie paella, fried fish, sandwiches, etc) and other smoked meats, such as reindeer, whale and moose. \n\nGreat location right at the bottom of the harbor by city center and one of my favorite spots in Bergen. Just look for the red tents and have fun exploring!!!",

It’s interesting how many of them seem to lean and sag but look solid at the same time. There is so much history here and the buildings are slowly being restored using traditional methods.

I’ve never seen a town that has this type of character. It looks like there is some good hiking, too. My complaint is that the shoppes were all closed because it’s “Sunday.” Not sure what that has to do with anything, as people still eat and shop on Sundays. I was also a bit surprised at how cold it was, but there’s nothing anyone can do about that. We still had a great time just looking at the outside of all the buildings. I liked how the sun was still out at 9:30 pm, making it feel like the day was longer. We did’t eat because prices are 3-4X what they are in the southeast US, but we did see a lot of places that looked really good and had a fun atmosphere if you are a foodie or want to splurge.",

It's a quick walk from the pier where cruise ships dock, so there's no excuse to miss out on this UNESCO site.  Go.  Shop.  Bring plenty of Krone.  And take a look around while you're walking.  You'll see leaning wooden buildings and colorful carved wooden figures hanging out on the store fronts.  (My fave is the unicorn, but the stag's head is a close second.  Word has it that these were added several centuries ago so that illiterate German workers could find places without having to read the native language.)",

As Fire was common , and this has always been wood in construction ,no candles or open flames were permitted. This made winter here terribly cold and dark . But must have been great during summer .\nPresently , the original wooden structures and hallways, now houses different restaurants ,offices, shops , and cafes. I had the opporunity to visit during summer in the past , and recently during winter. It is much more vibrant during summer when restos set up al fresco tables outside and the place is loaded with little kiosks, selling all wares . During winter it is quieter but you feel the history thru it’s walls just the same . The Heritage site includes the Fish Market across the river, the wharf , and the Bryggen Hanseatiske Museum . Most definitely a must visit when in Bergen",

She advised us to bring water proof, comfortable walking shoes, and a good rain coat.  We did.  We were grateful for the good shoes, but mother nature was kind, and we only need our rain coats a couple of times.  \n\nWe spent a couple of days of days in the city of Bergen.  We loved Bryggen, with all of it's old buildings.  Make sure you explore all of the alley ways.  We enjoyed some visiting all the shops, and love the art work we purchased that now hangs on our walls.  \n\nWe also wandered the Maritime museum and the Museum at the university.  Both were good.  Skip the aquarium, and spend that money else where, like the Rosenkrantz tower.   Definitely take a ride on the funicular.  We had a clear blue sky day, and the vista's are amazing. \n\nThe shopping district is large and fun to wander through. Remember to ask for the tourist receipt that allows you to get back the 25 % tax.  We missed a few of these receipts, but we did get over $700 back on everything we purchased.  \n\nAnd if time allows, go and see the visitor center and check into a Norwary in a Nutshell tour.  Well worth your day.\n\nWe loved Norwary, and if time and money allowed we would go and explore some more!\n",

      "text": "Bergen is a very walkable city, and one of its delights is how so many fascinating places are all within walking distance of each other.  Case in point is Bryggen, which was a trade center for the German Hanseatic League in the 14th century.  Narrow wooden buildings separated by equally narrow passages face the harbor and provide a glimpse into the life of this community of merchants who lived and worked in these buildings.  Because of the high incidence of fire (the city has been destroyed multiple time by fire that catches hold of the wooden timbers and spreads like, well….wildfire) no fire was allowed in the warehouses and living quarters, so all cooking and socializing was done in the Schotstuene, consisting of three assembly halls and a kitchen).  During winter months, due to the danger of fire, hot meals were served here, and the space was also used for teaching, meetings, parties, and courtrooms.  \nIn addition to simply walking around the very scenic row of buildings (a UNESCO World Heritage Site), you can get a first hand look at how these merchants lived and worked by visiting the Hanseatic Museum which is on the far side of Bryggen.  It’s fascinating to walk in the steps of merchants who lived in this space 800 years ago.  The exhibits throughout the museum (in English) show how the stockfish was received in Bergen, flattened and dried for shipment, and the upper floors are furnished in much the same way they were in the 14th century.  \nTickets for admission were 160 NOK (about $20), and this museum was well worth the cost.",

You are situated right on the water, and it is the perfect eperience for Norway tourists. \nYou can find all of the souvenirs, and gifts here that your heart desires. \n\nThere are several alleys where you will find other great shops owned and feature local artists, and crafts persons. Be sure to check them out. We spent more money in the back alleys than we did on the main street. \n\nThere is a great food truck that is situated here as well \"Norwegian Traditional Food\" \nWe ate here, because the name told us to. We wanted traditional Norwegian food, and this food shop did not disappoint. They had traditional Norwegian food, that is for sure. \nWhich was amazing I might add, but the service of the gentleman working the cart was even better. He understands he is catering to tourists - so he helped out these tourists and guided us on some amazing items. Thanks. \n\nThe views from this area are beautiful. lots of cool buildings, views of the mountains, the harbour, boats, and much more. \n\nTraveller Tip:  for the best photos of the iconic coloured buildings -  get there EARLY in the AM if you can before the tourists arrive - and you might get that perfect shot. \nFor great food - eat at the above mentioned food cart. You will love it.",

There are shops and pubs built into these old structures, and it makes for an enjoyable couple of hours.  It's kind of like spending a couple of hours in a historically reconstructed shopping mall.   \n\nThere are just a couple of spots in this district that can bring you back.  For example, you'll find Tracteursted Resturaunt all the way to the back, and even just stepping into the hallway to use their restrooms gives you a bit of the original feel.    And the Theta Museum give the cramped feel as if you're in the resistance from early last century.  But otherwise, it's as if you're in a historic shopping mall.\n\nActually, you would have seen a model of this if you ever went to Disney's Epcot.  Their Norway exhibit was meant to look like Bryggens.   While the real Bryggens is, of course, much more impactful - it's hard to learn more from it than from visiting Epcot.\n\nWe found the Bryggens Museum (a modern building just in front of St. Mary's) to, on the other hand, be a wealth of knowledge, and it has pilings from the original district.   Better yet, find your way to the Old Bergen Museum a couple kilometers north of the city, and its buildings as well as actors are designed to make you feel as if you fell back in time a couple hundred years.   If you have just a little time to spend in town and are interested in history, find your way to these two museums.",

Uneven floors in crowded houses that were also used for offices. Original nails and bolts. And, of course, the water and the boats and ships and kayaks.  Merchants doing business (well, OK, the t-shirts and crocheted moose baby booties might not be just like the \"old days\" may be pushing the envelope of authenticity, but still....)\n\nSeveral museums in the area add to the richness of the visitors experience; we especially enjoyed the Hanseatic Museum (Be sure to take the guided tour that's available with the visit at no extra charge-- it's brief, but very interesting and helpful.)",

It was a beautiful sunny day in June and I was told by a shopkeeper that it was not crowded compared to July or August.  Shocking considering that by the time we left by mid afternoon the streets and narrow alleys where some of the shops are, were difficult to navigate due to the crowds.  There are some good photo ops of the colorful facades of the old warehouses and there are lots of shops but I agree with some reviewers that the shops don't have interesting or affordable souvenirs and many items are not made in Norway anymore.  The restaurants while abundant were also pretty expensive to try to sample food in any of them.  The fish market nearby is interesting but equally expensive.  You will have to pass through this area if you are going to the tourism office.",

After taking more than 100 from foothill to hill-tops and at different spots on the mountain, I realised the designer had more to offer. Mount Floyen has more to explore, for kids, adults, friends, lovers, and family. The playgrounds are interesting and challenging, with short trails that leads to unexpected territories. On our way down hill, there was a sports ground with trampoline, tracks, work out equipment. And there are majestic villas commanding stunning views of the harbour and the city. The journey from the top to the bottom, looking at different houses, apartments, sheds, bungalows, it seems like a study of the city itself.\n\nThe lift of the funicular is, therefore, only a humble beginning of the journey.",

You cannot see anything while in the funicular (dont' expect a view). The view is at the top, but the edge is so crowded with tourists that it's difficult to really enjoy it.

      "text": "My acquaintances will tell you I have never met a rail based trip I didn't love.  The \nMount Floyen Funicular is not an exception.  Unfortunately due to the free time limits associated with our tour group we could only ride up, take a few pictures and then catch the same cars back down. \n\nI have been on several funiculars before, but this one was unusual for me in several respects.  First the line was not straight.  It curved several times on the way up. It was interesting to observe how the rails and cable guides were slanted to allow for these curves.  Second there were several intermediate stops. In thinking about it, there is no reason not to have intermediate stops, I have just never seen them before.\n\nIt was a very enjoyable ride, the view was terrific, however I strongly recommend you allow more than 30 minutes for the excursion.",

Our queue time was approximately twenty minutes and I would estimate at least one hour if you don't have tickets ahead of time.\nWe also had a baby in a stroller but not to worry because the tram accommodates both wheelchairs and strollers.\nThe facilities at the top included a gift shop, restaurant, childrens play area, goat petting, and numerous tiered viewing areas. It was wonderful.",

Another way was the Bergen at Night Segway tour.  We took the segways up and down the paths of the mount, an exciting, unique way to experience the views.  \nDo the short hike to the lake or enjoy the views while you kids play on the playground.  It is definitely the starting point for several hikes, if you want to do that as well.  The summer sunset was spectacular from up there.",

Very wide easy trail back to town.  Our favorite part of the experience. ",

At the top is a very expensive cafe/restaurant (take a picnic if you can) but stunning views over the city of Bergen. There are plenty of hiking trails, the obligatory scattering of trolls and plenty of things to entertain the kids (play parks, ziplines and a mini go-ape type affair).",

A quiet paved track then leads you back down, a lovely walk through the forest and wild flowers, birdsong and trickling streams. Eventually you enter a lovely residential neighbourhood, zigzagging down and down until you are back in Bryggen. This walk takes 45 minutes, but there are many places to stop and sit and enjoy the views to extend your quiet escape.\n\nOne of the few reasonably priced things to do in Norway!",

It took about 45mins or so, of course, depending on your speed...really enjoyed walking back down. The pathways to walk back down are well maintained and extremely safe.  It brings you right back to where you purchased the ticket.   Beautiful panoramic views from the top of the mountain...not to be missed.  The line up to buy ticket moved quickly, while waiting you can use the free WIFI, which is available outside the ticket office as well as inside while waiting to board the funicular.  \n\nThere is a nice restaurant at the top where you can purchase something to eat or drink or just to use the facilities.  For animal lovers, there are \"pet\" goats wondering around up there, just hanging around to take pictures with all \"us tourists.\"  which I did, of course:-)  \n\nIf you are looking for an activity while up there, you can do some hiking, zip lining and bike riding.  Yes, there is a bike rental shop at the top.  Most interesting, there is a kindergarten at the top of the mountain.  We saw and spoke to the teachers who said that they come up and go back down everyday with the kids.  \n\nIf on a cruise, here are directions to get there.  Walk out of the port, take a right, pass the sightseeing buses, there is also a sign-post pointing to \"Sentrum\" i.e city centre.  Once you get to a fork in the road, stay to the right.  You could go left but that would take you towards the fortress, although if you continue in that direction you would eventually get to the Floibanen (Funicular).  Okay, so stay to right after you pass the buses and you will eventually end up with the Fish Market on your right and the Funicular on the left.  If you go to the fish market, then to get to funicular you just walk straight ahead to the two big buildings on the corner, one of which says: Ann Madam.\"  Walk up the street between the two building and you will see the Funicular, pic attached.  \n\nThere are beautiful historic building, restaurant, bars and lots of other stuff around the city centre to explore and enjoy.",

In the summer there are canoes in the lake for the families with children. The pathways up there are well-marked for those who want long hikes, with some camping if you go far enough. Discounts with the Bergen Card. If the weather is nice this can be done early in the morning or in the afternoon after the museums and shops close. In the winter one can take sleds down the pathways down this mountain area. It is a great place to visit during all seasons - if you want to take pictures make sure you wait for a clear, non-rainy/NON-FOG day. Enjoy!",

At the top you can have more walks choosing the paths that start from the top of Floyen, going deep into the surrounding forest (there is also a small lake). Definitely to try.",

      "text": "Mt. Fløyen is awesome.  It looms over Bergen and provides excellent views of the city.  There are some trails and parks on top of the mountain, but mainly people go up it for the view.\n\nThere is a funicular railway that makes it quick and easy to go up and down the mountain.  We actually started walking up the mountain and decided to just walk all the way to the top.  This was a bit steeper and more strenuous than we imagined.  We did end up riding the funicular down, which was nice.\n\nIf you take a partial ride, it is half the price as tickets for the full trip.  There is a station very close to the bottom, which is easy to walk to.  This can work well riding down, but it will not work well riding up as the funicular will be completely full, and you will not be able to board it.  It does get crowded, so go early.\n\nWe had a lot of fun exploring Mt. Fløyen.  I only wish we had more time there.",

Yes there are pretty woods, flowers and meandering streams and little waterfalls but it is steep and not an easy walk. We thought we would be going thru the upper town but you only do that towards the end. It is mostly steep trails and since it is Bergen there are usually intermittent showers so be sure you have an umbrella or raincoat with a hood or a rain hat. Not an easy walk and if your plan for the rest of the day is to walk around the city you will be doing that on tired feet and legs with aching quads. ",

The first part is quite confusing through the streets with a lot of switchbacks and narrow streets but once clear of the town I just kept heading up. After a combination of steps, tracks and gravel road I made it to the top and got to see Bergen at it’s very best - beautiful sunrise, clear day - fantastic!\n\nGravity was a big help going down so didn’t take long and I was back in time for a well earned breakfast. From the Scandic Ornen hotel to the top and back was 4.5 miles and about 1200 ft vertical ascent. \n\nYou can take the funicular, walk or even take a taxi to the top but where’s the fun in that!",

No way to get lost as you can see the town below the entire walk down.\n\nWe took a picnic lunch and opted for the 5k easy hike to a lake a cabin. Warning to other US travelers - what Norway terms an easy hike appropriate for young children just starting to hike turned out to be intermediate/difficult by US standards with boulders to climb, steep ascents, and greater distance (5 miles) than the map indicated. Halfway through the hike was an old building with picnic table and scenic view over Bergen that was the perfect stop.\n\nI recommend you buy a one-way ticket on-line before leaving, pack a picnic, and take one of several hikes once at the top. You'll leave with forever great memories of Bergen. There were clean restrooms available in the funicular building once you get to the top.",

The top holds an extensive, open set up for lookout points (stairs and ramps are available). Despite the crowds, you can take photos without people in them. Savor your time up there - and don't rush - especially if the weather is extraordinary.  Grab an ice cream from the cafe at the top (a bit pricey, but worth the experience) and just look.

There is also a children's play park there which our two year old enjoyed.\n\nThere is a decent WC at the top with changing facilities.  \n\nFrom the views you can pretty much see the whole of Bergen so certainly worth a ride.\n\nThe train was very regular so there wasn't a long wait to get back down either.\n\nGlad we did this!",

They have two queues (pre-pay and not) and let an equal number of each in to the train.  So paying up front just ties you in - so when it rains (like it did for us) you cannot escape. \n\nSecondly, be aware of buying tickets from third parties.  We were told by quiet a few people that they were charged up to twice as much as the ticket price.  So caveat emptor. \n\nOverall, worth doing when in Bergen.  You will get some good photos of the city.  \n",

We did it on our own, which cost us a 15 min walk from the ship to Fløibanen station and the 95NOK pp (£9.50) for a Return Ticket. If you are over 67years old it’s even cheaper. From what I can tell the only difference in the trip is you don’t walk to the station, you get a coach to take you instead. Doing it this way also means that if there is heavy cloud cover you haven’t wasted your money on not being able to enjoy the views.\n\nAny way, those views – wow aren’t they spectacular, I’ll let the pictures do the talking although they don’t do them the full justice they deserve.\n\nAt the top after we had soaked up the views we had a bit of a wander around the woodland at the top and the shops that are on offer, finishing up with a giant cinnamon bun and a cup of tea. A little out of order today we got the trinkets before going back to the ship. \n\nWhen we got to the bottom after securing a front row perch on the Funicular we had to track down the Pandora store. Much to mums disappointment they had sold out of all the tourist Pandora charms for Norway. Sounds like an excuse to come back earlier in the season to me #Iona.\n\nFrom the top we could see a massive pool with fountain and some gardens with a square. So with the wonder that is Apple Maps we tracked it down.",

No staff were there to tell you which queue you should be in, it was left to you to find out.  We waited at least 45minutes until reaching the ticket office.  I had been instructed to exchange my on-line ticket there and was handed the 6 tickets for my party along with a receipt, showing the price I should have been charged had I just purchased them.  To my amazement the cost was about £12 less than I had paid.\n\nOn arrival home I emailed the company asking that the difference be refunded and was told that they fully understood my position but would not be refunding any monies due because they were agents and never said it would be cheaper to buy through them.\n\nMy recommendation is that you get there early, avoiding the queues, and pay at the ticket office.",

I went to cinema outside on the top of Fløyen . Sometimes you can have Yoga - classes and dancinglessons as well outside sometimes",

On this occasion I walked back down through the woods near the top and then the beautiful winding streets of colourful houses.  The second time I went up was late morning and there was quite a long queue but as the trains were more frequent than in the evening it moved fairly quickly. The ride in itself is great fun and the views of the city and the surrounding area are spectacular.  Well worth the fare.  I would definitely recommend walking down as there are many interesting sights on the way.",

The rest of the family had to get in a queue and walk up some stairs, but everything moved quickly. The view from the top is stunning you can see almost right round. Plenty of seating and photo opportunities. There is also a little gift shop, cafe and restaurant. There is also a play park for the children and woodland walks. You could easily spend a few hours there. The only downside was the price. I asked for a concession ticket for my mum. But was told they only sell them out of season. I thought that was a bit unfair.

      "text": "My husband and I opted to hike up to the top of Mount Fløyen and it was obviously that the space was used by many locals for a walk, run, training session, or activity park.  After passing the tram car that climbs the 1hr or so hike in about 15 minutes (and its sizeable line), we had the option of following the winding road or taking intermittent staircases that helped those who lived in the area reach their cozy, tucked-away neighborhoods.  I loved seeing the small knots of where people lived on the mountainside and that was one of my favorite parts of Bergen!\n\nThe climb is steep.  The paths are paved for cyclists and to make it easier for people to walk on solid, flat ground.  Just remember that you’re climbed pretty high elevation in a very short amount of time so you’re constantly walking up inclines.  the path was well-shaded and had magnificent views of the city along the way. \n\nWe reached the summit in about an hour and at the top, there are a few local establishments that can offer a small snack and a souvenir to a sit-down meal.  There are public restrooms (no cost) available at the top of the path and there are plenty of lookouts to capture amazing pictures of the view.  We did not pursue the other hiking paths at the top (Next time!).\n\nWalking down from Mt. Fløyen is pretty quick as it’s downhill; it is another hike that you should take slowly to avoid falling forward.  Just know that the native Norwegians and those seemingly training for running events will scoot right on by you.",

We chose the latter and had a late lunch there. The food was very tasty and while you could sit outside, there was a brisk wind, so we sat inside and enjoyed the view and the food from there. On the way down there are two options: take the funicular back down or walk. We walked and it was absolutely delightful. In addition to spectacular views, because we were there in spring, many wildflowers were starting to bloom. It took about 45 minutes to an hour and was easy walking on a wide dirt road. For me, the walk down was the highlight of this activity. ",

You can also do this in reverse but it is all uphill.\nFood and drink available too",

I personally find it like the usual view from the top\n\nAfter a few snaps, took a walk where we found a cafe, a souvenir shop, restaurant, a playground with a gigantic troll. Thats it, After less than 30 minutes, i begged to ride back\n\nSince its just by the wharf, i opted to end the day with a cold glass of beer\n\nMaybe ill check it again on summer or spring and hopefully i will have a different opinion about it\n\nNevertheless, twas memorable bring there with my favorite person in the world .\n\n",

In winter it could rain, snow or blow in the space of 10 minutes. And it can blow seriously strongly. Very cozy city to visit and easy to walk. The locals are very friendly and helpful to assist in any way. The Tourist Information Centre is most helpful.",

We saw a small herd of goats at the back of the cafe building.   Because of the temperature we did not do any of the other hikes, but took our time walking down back to the harbor.

Endless hiking possibilities and (in summer season) mountain bike rental, canoe, zipline and many other activities. Hiking (well sign-posted) ranges from short family walks to the lake to a 6 hour breathtaking walk to Ulriken (the other mountain). Very knowledgeable and kind staff at the info desk who gave us custom hiking recommendations. We could have spent days here. Will definitely be back for biking the forest!",

It's spectacular walking along the trails, passing lakes and finally climbing to a peak recommended by a Norwegian dad out with his two young sons. Out of season so the toilets were locked on the walk! Thank goodness for a cafe with facilities at the top.",

If you are feeling energetic you can walk up or down instead of using the railway.  One tip is to get to the ticket office early; if cruise ships are in there may be long queues.  You can buy tickets in advance; if you do the alternative queue is much shorter.  In either case, the queues move quickly.  A recommended place to visit.",

This is also a photographer or, in my case, a wannabe photographer’s dream. My wife and I ended up walking about 8 miles and enjoying every single step we took.

We still had to queue - less of a queue, more a mish mash of people- to get on the funicular. It doesn't seem very organised but fortunately it's not too long a wait to get on the funicular itself. Hold on to your tickets as you need them to get through the barriers, so stay together as a group - and be prepared to get separated on the train. It's only a short journey and they're keen to get as many people in the carriage as possible so it can be hard to enjoy the views on the way up or down. \nHowever, upon arrival at the top, the views are stunning and there is a large area where you can sit it stand for photo opportunities plus another platform you can walk down to (not too many steps) which offers the perfect photo location, where you can see a long way out. \nThere is a cafe and a nice little shop at the top and I expect you can do a bit of walking although we didn't do this.\nThe queues for the return journey down were more organised but still a bit messy getting on the carriage. \nOnce you get to the bottom, you're in the town centre where all the shops are and we walked from the Funicular back through the town, through the UNSECO site of Bryggen to our ship which only took about 30minutes at a leisurely stroll.",

Be sure to check opening times as we visited in October and the restaurant was closed for the season but everything else was open Saturday and Sunday but not during the week. There are two Handicapped Accessible toilets... one in the restaurant and another as you get off the funicular.  There is also a play area for children with some goats that wander around so be sure to check that out but don’t take food with you as you won’t have it long before the goats take it from you. Also .... the food is quite expensive as it is many places in Norway however I made the mistake of ordering soup without asking how much. It turned out to be a bowl of soup that could be refilled constantly but THE COST… The kroner equivalent to C$26!! Unreal!! And insult to injury ...It was cold!!  When travel extensively and I have to say this was the most overpriced food item that we have ever had. ....anywhere!!",

Be advised that it can get extremely crowded with LONG wait lines.  We took an early morning bus tour of Bergen, and our guide told us that in the morning, before some of the other ships dock ... the line is not bad ...so get there ASAP,     We got off our tour bus at the Bergen Hanseatic Wharf stop and did not return to the ship and only walked about three blocks and had a five minute wait to get to the top of Mt. Floyen.  We stayed at the top for about two hours .. had lunch, etc. and when we returned, the line had filled all the inside waiting areas and the maze out on the street.  We found out later there were four major cruise ships in port that day.  The views are spectacular, there are several restaurants and gift shops up top, and a very nice park with trails, zip lines, canoe rentals, bike rentals, etc.  This really gives you an overview of Bergen with its harbor history laid out before you.",

First the cart comes down the hill and then goes back in reverse. My fiancée said to have a better view should sit on the front raw which has a good observational glass. But the cart is operating in reverse. So my brilliant mind said that we should go for the rare side which is facing the direction of the motion towards Mount Floyen. So I overruled her choice and went to the rear end of the cart. Then there is no view and whatever the space available was for disabled. Rest is history. \n\nTop of the mountain you get the stunning view of the city. There are many restaurants available over there. We chose to take a walk down the hill through the Forrest. Many people anyway used to climb as well instead of using the Funicular. \n\nBelieve that walk is one of the most relaxing experiences I ever had. It’s a that kind of a place. I have posted some pictures. It might give you some idea. Never miss the walk. ",

The journey took about 6 minutes ride amazing views on the way up to at the top. There was no queueing for the return journey we walked straight on to the awaiting funicular.\n\nThere is a wide range of activities available at the top, however the hiking, zip lining and canoeing were not available when we visited, these activities are only available from June to  August. However, it was still possible to visit the Troll Forest and the lake, and enjoy the wonderful views of Bergen down below.\n\nWhile we were exploring, at the top, we encountered a number of goats wandering freely, they all had names, which was displayed along with photographs on one of the goat huts.\n\nThere was still plenty to do at the top and there is shops and restaurant.",

Possibly due to weather, but there were no queues when I went, I was advised, if going on a busy day - when weather excellent or cruise ships in - best to go before 10am or after 5pm. Bergen is such a great place for a visit but the Floyen Funicular is definitely its crowning glory.  ",

We quickly seized on our good fortune and took the funicular up to Mount Floyen.  There are paths to hike, a nice playground for kids, a hotdog stand and a  large restaurant with outdoor seating.  But the real deal was sipping a couple of Hansa Beers while sitting at one of those outside tables in the rare sunshine, and looking down at the harbor and city below.  It's quite the view.  Like I said, if you get a day like that in Bergen, drop everything and head up the funicular to Mount Floyen.  You won't regret it.",

      "text": "Mount Floyen has multiple paths that you can follow.  There are some which are well marked and some are slightly off trail (but still marked).   The presence of these multiple trails allows you to mix and match and see something different each time you visit. And what multiple trails also allows for is the spreading out of people so that you get the satisfaction of being close to nature and also a bit of solitude.  This was my absolute favorite activity in Bergen and although I had only planned on visiting it once, I ended up going every day and dropping most other things. \n\nAll the proper trails are centered around Brushytten (it's a cabin/shop).  So first make your way there - the signs will take you there easily.   What you won't find though is any signpost that shows all the trails that you can follow. I used Google Maps for this, zooming in enough shows the different hiking trails. \n\nSo here are a few minor hikes to try if you're looking for ideas.  \n\nMy first day I veered right at Brushytten and then walked all the way up the overlooking hill, then down and to the bottom of Store Tindevatnet - where there was an ancient looking wall that you can cross over!\n\nSecond day, veered left just before Brushytten to walk along Storediket, Nedrediket and Storevatnet.  About Storevatnet - continuing along will take you to Stoltzekleiven, so it's a bit busier than other parts, lots of people walking or running here. \n\nThird day, continued straight up from Brushytten which takes you further up the Floyen area for nicer views.  \n\nIt was perfectly fine walking here even in rain/overcast weather. There was a pretty good breeze as well which reduced the difficulty of any upward climbing.  \n\nAnd as everyone will tell you - always take water, snacks, proper hiking boots.",

      "text": "Date of Visit:  Friday, Aug 31st, 2018\n\nOne of the Must-do attractions in Bergen is the Mount Floyen Funicular. This ‘train’ shuttles you from the base of the mountain to the Top, where you will be greeted by some of the most spectacular views of Bergen – the fjords, the city, mountains, and waterfalls. \n\nWhen you arrive, you will see a very long line, do not let that discourage you, as it almost did us. If you do not have a ticket, just go to the left hand side – do not stand in that long line. The ticket booths are on the left hand side of the entrance building. The long line up is for Pre-purchase ticket holders. \nWhen you buy your tickets you will then be corralled forward. \nAs you get closer you will realize how fast the line really moves. \neach car holds about a hundred people, and there are 2 cars – one going in each direction at a time. \nThe ride is very short - they say 5 minutes, but it feels shorter. \nSo with 2 cars doing the mountain, those lines move fast. \n\nThe cost – not expensive – it doesn’t really matter the price – because the experience is worth it. \nIt is mostly 360 panorama glass – so you will get great views regardless where you sit or stand. \nThe rush is for the front of the car – but I just happened to get the seat at the back of the car going up. This provided me with a beautiful vantage point of the views of Bergen as we ascended the mountain. I think I prefer this. \n\nThe car is crowded – so if you cannot handle crowds – keep this in mind, but also – remember the ride is very quick. \nThere are stairs to climb once you get to the top, however people with real mobility concerns needn’t worry – there is an elevator. \n\nOnce you reach the top – WOW! – just gorgeous. All of Norway is gorgeous – but just when you think it can’t get any better --- you reach the top of Mt Floyen. \nBe considerate – everyone wants to get that perfect photo – so do not get pushy, and make way for others – so they will do the same for you. \nThere is a lovely set of stairs with a look out that is made of glass so it is perfect for photo ops. \n\nThere is a café to buy a bit of lunch, a gift shop to buy some souvenirs, there is a children’s park – complete with a Troll Statue. \n\nIF you come to Bergen, a trip to the top of Mt Floyen on the Funicular is a must. \nIt won’t eat up a lot of your time, so just make it happen. \nThis is definitely a must-do on your next trip to Bergen, Norway",

There is whole list of activities you can do up there from adventure sports, play in park, see wild cattle, good restaurant options, perfect place to see sunrise and sunset and most importantly the a photo opportunity where you will not stop clicking pictures.\n\n3. The walk down is interesting as the landscapes keep changing and the neighborhood and house are interesting sights.\n\n4. For people who would not like to walk down all the way, take the funnicular to one station before the final station on your way down. You can start walking from there on and it is 15 mins from there.",

The system to get on the funicular is very organised but it feels like they crowd so many people in it and so its not fun for people who have other people in front of the them and cant see the view. Once we got to the top, the viewing point was spectacular and there was a nice seating point and place to take pictures.

However, the walk can be a bit steep so if you have trouble walking I do not recommend,",

Trails are were wellconditioned and distance via road down to valley is approx 3km and offering nice woods plus sights and norwegian houses via roads.",

There are colourful wooden houses, a fortress, a fish market with dining, lots of shops and the Funicular railway, The queues to buy tickets and then to queue for the train can be considerable. My advice is to purchase the tickets on line through the web site, which then allows you to bypass the ticket queue. The trains run frequently to the summit so the queue does steadily move along.  The views at the top are amazing and worth the waiting time, although a clear day is best. The woodlands and walks aat the top are also very good and there are play facilities for children of various ages, toilets and a gift shop. Unfortunately some of the organised tours simply do not allow enough time at the summit. We explored alone and easily spent 2 hours  but were aware others on tours were only allowed about 30 minutes. Bergen, like most places in Norway is expensive compared to UK prices so be aware if dining or shopping. The weather in Bergen can be wet so best be prepared. We enjoyed our day in Bergen and would happily re-visit on a future occasion.",

The ride is fast and views at the top are amazing. Also awaiting you are the resident goats who are clean, tame, and pet-able! So cute. Lots of hiking trails, a lake, a decent restaurant with clean bathrooms, and a nice gift store. Ice cream is available too. A very lovely visit.",

There were four separate segments to our experience of the mountain. The first was a ride up the mountain on a funicular which ascends from the centre of the city to the mountaintop in a ride of less than ten minutes, one which provides great views during the ascent. The second segment was our time on the mountaintop whose various viewing stations provided breathtaking views of Bergen, it's harbor and the surrounding countryside. The third segment was our invigorating hike down Mount Floyen through forests and eventually past older mountain residences. Finally, when we reached the bottom of the mountain just to the left of the entrance to the funicular station we found a great bakery with delicious coffee and baked goods. Overall, it was a great afternoon in Bergen!",

Taking in the view via the Funicular is one of the first things they do when they land, and you can find yourself waiting an hour for the ride.     If you have the stamina, you can walk up.  It's a couple mile uphill trek, and you get a good feel for the city.   Otherwise, head up there in the afternoon after the crowds die down.\n\nThe best place to stand is at the bottom of the car to get an unobstructed view.  If you can't get that, find a place to stand along the railing of the section you're standing in.\n\nAt the top, you'll find a few things including an ice cream shop.   It's a place meant to deal with the high volume of tourists, so don't expect gourmet.  But an icy treat is great for hikers.\n\nPhotographers would want to get up there either really early in the morning or after sunset.   The late day sun shines right at the top of the hill, so it's hard to get a good photo straight into the light after around 11am in summer.",

Tons of photo opportunities with the city and mountains in the background and not too crowded (keep in mind this was March so it might be more crowded in the spring and summer). There's a hotel up there and a gift store. When we went this time, there was a ton of snow. This is important because they do not treat the path so you're in for a lot of ice and rail holding walking down. I was a bit scared during one portion of it as I'm super clumsy and shuffling along a sheet of pure ice downhill is terrifying to me. The first time we did it, the path was clear and it's not a bad walk at all. I'd definitely go back again if in Bergen.",

Going down to to the window facing forward and prepare your camera. However dont push and shove to get there, better to wait for the next car and position yourself first to get in. Its worth the minor wait as long as you can do so politely. \nThe area is clean and well maintained,",

Please, please walk off the ship early and head straight to the funicular. You can then go up without queuing, enjoy the scenery (with relatively few other people around) and explore the area, all before the 'fast tracked' cruisers. We laughed as we came down from the viewing area to find a very long queue of cruise passengers who thought they were being fast tracked - they were yet to go up and we had already spent a good two hours exploring! \nA note on mount Floyen, there is much more beyond the viewing platform. Take a look around the troll garden, stroll up to the lake (free canoe experiences from 11am) and have a general ramble around. My children also loved the play areas. Well worth the money to climb the funicular.",

The views upon arrive were fantastic!\n\nThere was a bit of a line, but not as bad as we had heard it could be.  Actually, it's two lines:  one to buy the ticket and then one to board.  We had purchased our ticket as part of the sightseeing bus, so could skip the first line and the wait for the second was about 15 minutes.\n\nAt the top, in addition to views, there were food and snack outlets, shops, and trails for hiking the Norwegian woods.  Well worth the trip!",

The cost is comparatively reasonable (once one gets used to the high cost of everything in Scandinavia).\nThe attractions at the top are mostly what one would expect – cafes, ice creameries, souvenir shops – except for perhaps the goat house. Don’t ask. \nThe views from the several vantage points are, also as one would expect, spectacular.\nWe would recommend a one-way ticket, as the walk down is not at all arduous, and quite simply beautiful; through peaceful, lightly forested countryside, where you will unexpectedly find sub-tropical plants in abundance, lichen-covered rocks in gorgeous colours and patterns, babbling brooks (yes, they do actually babble) and birdlife galore – more heard than seen. There are also some more lookout points to enjoy on the way, and towards the bottom, back streets and lanes to explore.\nJust do it.\n",

The view from above is spectacular and worth it just for that but there is so much more - buy yourself a cinnamon roll and coffee (or hot chocolate) and people watch - go for a hike or just a walk to one of the nearby lakes (easy walking on gravel paths or even paved in some cases). Go for a (free) canoe paddle on the nearest lake (only between noon and 3pm in the summer).  And then, walk down via one of the two or three paths - again paved so you can take a pram/bike/wheelchair as well.  We saw plenty of people walking up (and some running) as well.

We also walked right on to our return trip.  The views at the top are spectacular, but weather dependent.  Lots of photo opportunities.  Also at the top are some shopping and dining venues.  For the outdoorsy types there is hiking and biking... as well as playgrounds for the kids.  If you are into trolls, there are plenty of them too.  Remember, with the change in elevation comes temperature change, so prepare accordingly.  This attraction is highly recommended by our group of four highly experienced travelers.",

Bicycle hire is also available next to the Troll Forest, so it would be quite easy to spend most of the day there if you had the time and good weather.\n\nI think the tickets cost about €10 if bought from the ticket office, and I think it will be one of the best €10 you can spend in Bergen!",

The mountain bike experience with beautiful hillsides and forest, little lakes and great views of Bergen, is good reason for taking selfie - not during the bumpy ride, of course. \nWe aren't experts and it's the first time our family (including our eight-year-old daughter) to try the hard-tailed mountain bikes. We were overtaken by loads of cyclists during our mountain bike ride. We realised then that we should simply sit down and relax. No rush.

After the two buses out of town to get there we arrived a bit late for the tour but they let us in and we caught up with it. The tour was in Norwegian (which I understand) and the machines were great to see! My partner who is not a knitter, found the industrial history of the place super interesting. I feel that it does help a little to have some knowledge about how yarn is made before coming to the museum and It may be an idea to show how the process was done by hand before these machines, as that was one of my biggest take aways. \n\nI noticed some other reviews commenting on the price of the yarn in the shop. I felt that it was actually very reasonable for small batch, non-masproduced yarns. I do wish that they sold bigger skeins or more cones! \n\nWe missed the bus on the way back, so got to enjoy the cafe for an hour. There are many books to look at, as well as cakes and drinks. I enquired about vegan snack options and was told they had vegan berry ice cream. \n\nAll in all a great visit and I look forward to coming back during the strikkefestival!",

The fact that these are not done by professionals is what makes it so unique and charming.  Truly it is the whole (not the individual pieces) that make this come together so well.

Of course adult create some mountains and an electric train etc, but the result is a 'town' that is very inconsistent and of varying quality.\n\nThe whole thing is 'cute', and one can really not spend more than 30 minutes there.\n\nThe staff is super friendly and if you are travelling with kids yourself, there is a play area inside as well so this may be a good place to go.\n\nIf you are on a budget I would recommend you safe yourself the 100 NOK entrance fee.\n\nI was told the 'town' is build every year since 27 years and always starts around the 20th of November and always ends on the 31st of December.

Downstairs are presented nice exhibitions dedicated to the Viking Age and Stone Age. At exhibition related to Viking period is shown the history of different artefacts (e.g. jewellery, weaponry) which were robbed on 14th August 2017 and retrieved in October 2017. This fascinating exhibition presents also basic problems connected with the conservation of various archaeological finds. Stone Age exhibition presents the various finds dated to this period which were discovered in Norway. \n\nAt other exhibitions in the University Museum of Bergen are presented in an interesting way medieval art (e.g. beautifully decorated portals), the art of western Norway and history of theatre. \n\nIn my opinion, during the visit to the University Museum of Bergen, we can not only see nice exhibited finds but also learn a lots of interesting facts about prehistory and history of Western Norway. Totally worth visiting!",

The Museum encompasses a large area. The history of Norway, Cultural changes and Exhibits are fascinating. There are a variety of Exhibits which kept us looking forward to what we would discover next. \n\nAfter leaving the Museum, we wandered around the botanical gardens which are adjacent. The gardens were beautiful, the area was quiet & peaceful. We then stopped at \"Godt Brod\" restaurant which is on the 2nd floor of a University Bldg with a deck looking out over the gardens. Great place to rest and reflect on the day.",

We were lucky to try bus no 10, got out right after the tunnel and went via passenger bridge to the buildingon top of the hill looking like the city walls - actually in that building the museum is situated, turn after the gate to left and you'll see it. They will recommend a short (some 10-12 minutes) film on Vikings and you will be shocked with brutality they have shown, especially to the women after the death of leader. Museum is mid size and can be seen relatively fast but was interesting with some of the replicas of Viking ships and maritime exibits of later eras. great view from one side to one of the Bergen's ports.",

So many model ships and boats to look at, so much to read, so many battles between the Danes, Norwegians and Swedes!!   Towards the end a very interesting exhibition of ships used during WW2.",

The new exhibit uses thousands of artifacts and modern historical and archaeological research to let you come closer to the everyday lives of the medieval people of Bergen and Western Norway. Runic inscriptions with gossip, poems and spells tells us about faith and love, while ceramics from Europe and the Middle-East shows an extensive and international trade network. The new exhibit also displays the unique Guddal-garment - a nearly thousand year old find, which is one of extremely few relatively intact pieces of Norwegian medieval clothing.",

HUNDREDS of artifacts are not labeled nor at least dated! You have to try to find by yourself at what they have been used  and when !! Imagination is in power!\nMoreover they gave to you some letter format Xerox copies in bad quality w/ only fews tens of artifacts described of an unique  round glass cabinet (over the tens displayed!).\nWhen I complain about that facts no excuses even the thead to put me out of this museum by the public force !!!\nYou a have to understand what \"sneak preview\" for a museaum can means (and only into a small post outside the museum entrance!)",

It actually took us 18 minutes to see it all!  What we were not told was that the museum was being renovated and therefore only the basement was open.  So all of the exhibits were in the basement, as the rest of the floors were off limits. None of the exhibits was labelled and thus we had no idea what we were looking at. There was a typed brochure which was meant to explain what everything was, but it didn’t really help. For instance, there was a skeleton in the exhibition, labelled \"skeleton\" in the brochure - which was completely unhelpful. \n\nWe have just noticed that the museum had been closed due to renovation between Sept 2018 and May 2019. I think it should still be closed. We were not warned that most of the museum was closed in advance of purchasing our ticket and feel rather cheated. The least they should have done was vastly reduce the entrance price so that it reflects what is actually available to see.  We were told it would be fully open in Sept 2019. So don't waste your time or money going before then.",

One annoying feature is an admission charge [75 krones] and a prohibition on photography. I can understand no flash photography but the combination will limit tourists for one reason or the other.

  "description": "One of the most important monuments of the Renaissance. Close to Hakon’s hall lies the Rosenkrantz Tower, which is considered to be the most important Renaissance era monument in Norway. Parts of the tower are from the 1270s, but it has been built upon several times, both for defensive purposes and as a demonstration of power over the wilful Hanseatic merchants. Through dim and narrow stairways you can climb all the way to the roof, where the view over the city, the harbour and the fortress is impressive even today. On Sundays and all through the summer season one can take part in tours (for an extra NOK 20) which include both Hakonshallen and the Rosenkrantz Tower. Daily 9 until 16 from mid may-mid september.",

I loved almost every second of it.  The moments I did not like were only a couple of occasions when there were cutout-style images of people in a space - I found it very startling and jarred me out of my time-travel experience.  But it was easy to get back into it because the place just oozes history.  Love that there are items you can handle and try on in some of the rooms and written information (in a number of languages) in others.  I could have spent quite a bit of time in there, just soaking it up and imagining what the walls would say if they could talk.",

I recommend keeping this in mind if you visit during the renovations. Additionally, many of the rooms I saw had nothing in them. They need to update the signs (bigger, clearer fonts) inside the rooms, for the dim lighting conditions and older peoples' eyesight.",

      "text": "The Rosenkrantz Tower was clearly an important structure through much of Bergen’s history and you can get a good understanding of its changing structure, use and importance via a tour.  It does not have the extensive displays of historic armor, weapons, furniture, furnishings and implements that you might find in some other European castles.  Some of the rooms are nearly bare spaces.  Nearly all of the windows were boarded up when we visited, making the rooms dark, if not claustrophobic.  However, extensive work is being done, so that may very well be temporary.  \nThe historical presentations that were provided were interesting, particularly the ones on a witch trial and a major battle during the Anglo-Dutch wars.  Stairways are steep, narrow and winding, so anyone with mobility issues should be aware of that.",

The castle looks wonderful and the garden is very nice. I was there for about 1 and half hour walking through the garden and sit at the sea calming down after the long flight from Germany.  Right after I decided to walk to Troldhaugen. It’s about 4 km to go and it took about 1 hour. It’s a easy walk just the last few meters up to Troldhaugen are a little bit harder (comparing to the rest) If you’re having enough time I’ll recommend to do this walk. I saw so wonderful landscapes just by waking from one village to an other. ",

There are no reproductions here - just what survived the war.  \nThe volunteer was helpful and it was truly a joy to go through something that he was obviously quite proud of.\nAs museums go, I have a one to two hour maximum attention span.

It is focused on the underground units in the Bergen area...the Oslo Resistance Museum has a different focus and is also very good.\nThis display provides numerous examples of the dedication, ingenuity and risk taken by members of the resistance. It also describes the various political elements that made up the resistance. It is stunning to see pictures of Bergen from this time when it was occupied by the Nazi powers. After learning of the sacrifices made my numerous persons and the tortures received at the hands of the SS and Gestapo it was somewhat comforting to know that many of the Nazi perpetrators were executed just outside of this museum. \nDisplays have Norwegian and English descriptions.",

Also you will learn about the resistence movement in Bergen in WWII and how 240-250 members of resistence were arrested by ocupation forces after a treason.

It is told with story-boards, photos, first-hand written accounts and military artifacts, including some weapons.  It tells the story of a nation surprised by the initial attack and then subjugated by the ruthless, brutal suppression of the Resistance.  Overall, the details of this struggle  are little known history outside of Norway.  My wife and I were very impressed with the information and how it was presented.  I pride myself on my knowledge of WWII but I learned a lot at this museum and it was fascinating.  If you are a WWII History Buff, this is a must place to go in Bergen.",

It also showed how cruel the Nazi party was to the Norwegian resistance. It's important to point out the British and the USA forces might not have been able to win the war when the did with out the resistance. we all need to work together and pull on the same side of the rope. Found this all very fascinating. The rest of the fortress was closed due to a annual music festival. There is English books and most displays have English too.",

Even in France (where they refuse to have alternative languages) we were able to muddle through the process. (We also speak Spanish and German, so that might help). So, we arrived here late at night, trains were running every 15 minutes, and the price was right (about $10 for the two of us). The ticket station even had an English option. Perfect!  But then we tried to use it. Quite confusing, especially when we just wanted to go to the end of line at downtown, a few minute walk to our hotel. Instructions started off in English, then suddenly went to Norwegian. We were lost, and could not find the NOK 38 option anywhere, as the advertised price shown next to the ticket terminal. We tried it a half a dozen times, with the same confusing results. Maybe we were tired, or pressed a wrong button, but we eventually gave up as a train came and went.  We walked across the road and hired a $86 taxi. Good payday for him, not so good for us. \nSo, this review is a long-winded way of pleading for better instructions for the tired international tourists arriving into your beautiful city!",

Regular and very well used service.  Stop about 4 minutes walk from my hotel too so ideal.",

  "description": "A stone hall worthy of a king Hakonshallen is more than seven hundred and fifty years old, and was built by King Hakon Hakonsson between 1247 and 1261 as a royal residence and feasting hall. When the king’s son Magnus Hakonsson Lagabøte married the Danish Princess Ingeborg in 1261, 2000 guests were hosted in three buildings. \"Kings held court in the stone hall\", as the sagas say. Hakonshallen is open most days of the year, even in the winter. On Sundays and all through the summer season one can take part in tours which include both Hakonshallen and the Rosenkrantz Tower. From mid may-mid september open daily 10 until 16. From mid september - mid may (winter) open daily 12 until 15.",

The only decorations were tapestries on the wall and a royal table at one end of the hall.  It’s an okay place to visit, but I think there are more interesting places to see in Bergen.",

When the capital was moved, the building fell into disuse but remained standing. During WW2 it was the accidental casualty when Norwegian saboteurs blew up a Nazi ship in the harbour and in 1950s it was restored to its former glory.",

Its expensive though, and no discount considering much of it is closed and the self-guided tour was somewhat confusing and disoriented. I'd perhaps see how far along things are before visiting. At about 20$usd i remember for entrance, its not a lot of bang for your buck.",

It’s located between the Bergen train station at one end and Byparken at the other. Beautifully decorated with yellow tulips during our visit. Nice place for a leisurely stroll on the path that circles the lake or taking a break on one of the many benches. ",

      "text": "Monday 3rd September we were out and about exploring and sightseeing in Bergen and this monument was one of the attractions that we visited.\n\nThe Sailor's Monument (Sjømannsmonumentet) is in honor of Norwegian sailors from Viking times to modern days.\n\nThe statue with its infinity pool and fountain, is situated in the center of Torgallmenningen, the main square in Bergen, and it is pedestrianised around it.\n\nEach side of the square-shaped monument represents a different age of sailing, with a total of 12 statues and four reliefs, equally positioned on each of the sides.\n\nIt only takes a few minutes to walk around, it is definitely worth a look at.",

Our walls are covered with graffiti art and we have more than 70 trampolines including multiple 4x4 olympic sized trampolines. We also have Walking walls, jump through walls, a really large foam pit, Dodgeball court, Ninja Warrior course, Wipeout, Slam dunk basketball court and a lot more fun activities. All this along with a great light show and good music from the speakers makes this a pretty fun visit. We also have a cafe overlooking the park with surprisingly good food.",

Bursadagsverten var med barna og hjalp dem under lek under hele perioden i parken. I tillegg stilt de 3 verter og sang bursdagssangen🙂👍. Samtidig er fasilitetene når det gjelder resturant og fersk mat fra kjøkkenet i en særklasse. Vil anbefale dette til alle som ønsker å ha det gøy og samtidig bli tatt vare på. Godt jobbet Flipzone, dere har fått til noe unik i Åsane  som skiller seg klart ut i forhold til andre med samme konsept. Kommer klart til å benytte dere igjen. Sønnen min er frelst etter ett besøk 😀",

The view at the top was towards the sea, I preferred this to Mount Floyen. The summit was pretty wide but there is no buildings or shelters to go to. It was also pretty windy day when we went there, so it was good we were wearing windproof jackets.",

Dette er en vanlig angrepsform på hjemmebane og en kampform de har brukt i hele 2018 sesongen. Det lønner seg umiddelbart. Haugen får ballen på 16-meteren, får et reint treff på ballen og denne er utagbar for keeper. Brannspillerne presser hele kampen høyt og Strønsgodsespillerne blir etterhvert slitne for hele kampen å måtte jage ballen. Sluttresultat Brann 3 - Strømsgodset 1. Gullet ska hem. Heia Brann. Det var mange ledige plasser på tribunen. Synd ikke flere bergensere og striler tar seg råd til å kjøpe kampbilletter til Branns hjemmekamper.",

  "description": "Xhibition is one of the city's newest shopping mall, with over 40 stores in the heart of Bergen! Xhibition is more than just a new and exciting shopping mall, but also a meeting place for experiences and well-being beyond the ordinary. Already on the opening day, June 10, 2004, thousands of people became acquainted with us, and we were delighted by the overwhelming interest. In 2019 we are ready to give you new and exciting experiences. Our goal is for you to be in the center of all our shops and restaurants. To put an extra tip on the shopping - enjoy delicious food and drinks at Jacob Aall's outdoor terrace on the roof or freshly baked pastries at Solbrød on the 1st floor, or perhaps a freshly made muffin at Wayne's Coffee in the 2nd floor would do the trick. Welcome to Xhibition Shopping Center!",

  "description": "We are very happy to present this beautiful classical summer house to our visitors. In the 1700s, Bergen was a large, busy and rich city. The city’s upper classes adopted trends from the continent and established elaborate, aristocratic homes in the countryside. By 1800 one would find around 70 of these summer houses in the countryside surrounding Bergen, and Damsgard was the most stunning. Damsgard Country Mansion, as it appears today, was built in the 1770s for General War Commissioner and General Customs Manager Joachim Christian Geelmuyden (1730-1795). Geelmuyden was knighted in 1783, and took the name Gyldenkrant. The house he built at Damsgard is still considered to be a masterpiece of Rococco architecture in wood in Norway, and it is perhaps Europe’s most authentic wooden building from that period. Garden exhibition can be visited all trough the opening hours. Access to the mansion only in guided tours. Guided tours: 12:00 & 14:00, Sundays also 13:00. Open June-Aug daily.",

The fountain is in a nice shaded area making for a very pleasant location to visit. ",

There was a video installation playing in one of the rooms, again well positioned and good effect just the type of film wasn’t my cup of tea\n\nCafe space looked nice & was busy but I didn’t stop for anything there.\n\nOverall I enjoyed the gallery, & on balance a bit more than the three KODE galleries that I visited later",

  "description": "Hordaland kunstsenter was established in 1976 as the first artist-run art centre in Norway. The core of our activities is our exhibition program, in which commissioning new projects from international artists plays an important role. Since 1987 Hordaland kunstsenter has hosted a residency program, which was initially open to Nordic region artists, but is now open to candidates of any nationality. Our aim is to increase the visibility of contemporary art in and from Norway, and to create opportunities for exchange between arts professionals in different geographic and political contexts. Hordaland kunstsenter´s bookshop carries a broad range of magazines and books dealing with contemporary art and culture. Welcome!",

  "description": "From catechism to the mortarboard. The School Museum and the Holberg museum are co-located in the old Latin school building, just north of the Cathedral, and are entered from Lille Øvregate. This is one of the country’s oldest school buildings, which previously housed one of our oldest schools. It was called the Bergen School, and for half a millennium after its establishment in the mid 1100s it was the only school in the city. That which began as a seminary would later become a ‘Latin school’ and a ‘gymnasium’, the gateway to academic training for generations of Bergen residents and others. The school, now the Bergen Cathedral School, still exists, in a more modern location on the other side of the cathedral. The Museum will be closed in 2018. Groups on request.",

      "text": "Our desire was to leave tourist-filled Bergen and make our way along the sunny, warm southern coast of Norway, to experience more of the normal lifestyles of the country.  We booked a passage on the Fjord Lines ferry from Bergen to Stavanger for $38, although the ferry landed at Risavika, then a short bus ride to Stavanger.  We took a cab in Bergen to the ferry dock and then got in line to check our luggage, and proceed to a waiting area for the gates to open.  Once we actually heard announcements for boarding, we showed our tickets and proceeded onto the ferry.  We headed toward the bow and the open lounge with comfy chairs and full windows onto the bow of the ship below.  We had drinks and watched the scenery while the area filled with passengers and finally under way.  We passed by the exceptionally clean, organized galley area earlier and visited that again for food.  The galley area had a wide selection of snacks, hot meals, and drinks all with prices in Denmark Kroner- roughly the same as Norwegian Kroner.  The ship was from Denmark so that was the only currency used, so we wore down our credit card numbers on frequent visits to the bar and galley.  There was an ATM on board, but only gave out Danish Kroner to add to my currency collection.  We walked on the cold outside deck on the windward side.   We found a top level deck with a broad area for walking around outside when it was less windy.   The entire ferry was modern and very clean as was the entire staff.    There was a wonderful selection of Scandinavian foods, especially chocolates.  We found all the food delicious and reasonably priced.\nAlong the route were wonderful towns and boats to watch as well as the mountains and occasional bridges.  We met several passengers from Europe and Scandinavia, all speaking English and full of questions about America.\nWe docked in Risavika, and left the boat hurriedly after we realized the ferry didn’t go all the way to Stavanger.  There was a bus waiting in the parking lot for those of us who had paid to get to Stavanger.  We boarded the bus and 20 minutes later were dropped off in Stavanger at the bus station.  I plan on returning to Norway and riding a ferry somewhere there again, either with Fjordline or Hurtigruten.",

Vi hadde måltidene våre her,og jeg var ikkje fornøyd. \nDet var feks samme rettene både fredag og lørdag,samt at søndag frokost fikk vi ikkje spise frokost når vi ville,vi var tidlig ute for å spise frokost(0630) og fikk beskjed at vi ikkje kunne spise før 0830!! Det var mye ledige plasser her!! Når vi omsider fikk satt oss å spise,fikk vi også høre ved nabobordet at dei som jobbet kom bort til de og sa at tiden deres var brukt opp og de måtte forlate frukost bufeen!! Dette er uansett det rareste jeg har opplevd,må nå få lov å nyte måltidet så lenge bufeen er åpen uten å måtte risikere å bli kastet ut. Her må dere finne en løsning Fjord Line .",

Gorik was the best guide!  He quickly showed us how to operate the segways and then we headed out, stopping every so often at interesting or beautiful (usually both) places. We covered so much ground in two hours and Gorik’s knowledge of Bergen combined with his fun personality was brilliant.  He gave exactly the right amount of history for us but, let’s be honest, you book this tour for the segway! Scooting around the little streets, up and down hills was definitely the highlight. We had an amazing time and would recommend to anyone - if you get Gorik as your guide, that will be a definite bonus. Thanks Gorik (and all the best with your little one H&Jx).",

Our 1-2 hour tour took us to all the nearby sights and even to a great overlook point above the city. By the end we had a good lay of the land and were able to go back to sights that interested us. Due to the size of Bergen, I think an overview before you start to walk around town is crucial.",

If you're used to driving a snowmobile or a bicycle, you turn the handlebars, which definitely does not work on a Segway!  There wasn't as much commentary from our guide as I was expecting, but she was definitely patient and friendly.  And we did see some lovely sites.

      "text": "We did the night Segway tour in Bergen. I know the description said it would go to the top of Mt. Floyen, but I hadn’t really thought about what that entailed. It means you are riding up narrow roads with hairpin turns in the dark to the top of the mountain that overlooks Bergen - through a neighborhood with some very beautiful houses, through a dark forest (short distance) to the top. While I was a little nervous, that I would wreck the Segway over a cliff, the view at the top was absolutely breathtaking and it was much less nerve wracking going down oddly. Our guide was great and they do provide rain ponchos. I know a lot of the reviews complain about weather / rain...so here is the deal- it rains in Bergen A LOT. It’s rained every day since we got here. If you let the rain stop you, you will miss out on so much fun and such a beautiful city. Bring your rain gear (including waterproof shoes) and get out and enjoy it! You with LOVE the Bergen Segway tour! A definite must do while in Bergen!!",

After checking the wind he offered to reschedule but as we were flying onwards the same evening, and as an exception, he  offered us a refund.  It was a great loss for us as Bergen by Segway is an activity not to be missed but at the same time we appreciate the gesture of goodwill on behalf of the company. \n If you are in Bergen do try the Segway tour!!",

Decided to waste 250.00 as we could not chance not getting back to the ship in time. If you are at the remote locations you better have a lot of time . Really disappointed.

It is good if you have some dexterity with your body and trust in the unit. Some things seem counterintuitive at times and you will kinda panic. Take your time and you should be fine. The route takes you on sidewalks, streets and alleyways. There is cobblestone and narrow passageways to manage along the way.   You must watch for pedestrians as they are everywhere.  All of that being said, we saw a lot from the shore to old town and everything in between. Lots of fun!  One more thing, the store front is not easy to find. It is located on the right side of a long warehouse type building. You enter through a garage door. Look for the Segway flag out front.",

We started checking our e0mail  The owner/manager/or whomever, came over to us and told us that the bench (about 3 feet by 18 inches deep) was only for customers!  Can you imagine that?

The room should be recommended for less people. Since the rooms are not rated for difficulty on their website, it makes it seem like we would need more people to solve the room, when in fact this is not the case.\n\nI would recommend the room we played only for people who have not played an escape room before, or who want a guaranteed win.",

They recommend us their best seller cocktail, a spicy one with raspberries, ginger and spicies at least. First of all, the menu was really funny, with a lot movies references and a large sense of humor and a large choice of surprising cocktails. We tried 4 of us, with different tastes and all were delicious 😋\nA place to recommend! ",

It can get very crowded on weekends and difficult to get in (like most bars), so my friend and I waited till an off night to try it. The drinks were excellent albeit pricy. We were both a bit travel weary at the time, so the low key atmosphere was perfect. I believe the Norwegian word for it is \"koselig\". At a basic level its a feeling of groundedness and appreciation for where you are and when you are. The word is a catch-all for the feeling derived from good atmosphere, company, and being in the moment. This place is what I think of when I think of koselig. Between the comfortable lighting, amazing cocktails, homey furniture, and of course the friendly Norwegian people (seriously so incredibly kind), this is an excellent stop if visiting Bergen. I'd call it a can't miss.\n\nThere was also a Nintendo 64 with Mario Kart which is an extreme boost in my book.",

You will never tire of looking at the decor – an amazing collection of, well, everything. Really friendly people, great music, and very comfy, squashy seating, that's very difficult to get out of after a few beers. I believe they serve food, although we didn't eat here.\nWhen we return to Bergen, this will be top of our list of places to revisit.",

We went to six different restaurants/food establishments and ate and drank a lot!  We took the afternoon tour and skipped dinner that night.\n\nWhat we learned about Norwegian food came in handy during the rest of our time in Norway - we ended up going back to one of the six places we went to on the tour for lunch the next day, and we also ordered a dish we had tasted during the tour at dinner another night.  In addition to learning about Norwegian food, we also learned about Bergen, Norwegian holidays, and Norwegian customs.  \n\nAfter the tour Rachele emailed us a summary of where we went and what we ate and even included recipes for a couple of the dishes.  That was much appreciated.\n\nAll in all it was a great tour and I recommend it highly!",

The food tour was a perfect way to explore Bergen city centre, learn something about the city, and taste some excellent food from places most tourists wouldn't know to visit.  Our tour guide Ina was enthusiastic and engaging, and as a local Bergen resident knew a lot about the city and the food scene.  We tasted salmon and trout at the fish market, had fish soup at another stop, and my favorite was the reindeer sausage.  We would highly recommend doing the Bergen Food Tour with Cheyenne and Ina when visiting Bergen, especially if you are on a cruise and want something more unique than a typical cruise excursion.",

Who could ask for more! Local Bergen Ina was our guide and she was upbeat, very willing to answer questions and expertly explained the details of all tasting items. She also followed up with an email that provided more information about the food we tasted and even provided a recipe. There were eight in our group, but Ina managed to make us all feel very special, and we (my hubby and I) enjoyed the energy and fun of the event as much as the food itself!

We tried a local fish \"fast food\" that has been in assistance since the 1920s - tried 4 different items here, my favorite was the fish soup!  Next we headed to a lovely quiet dessert place to try the brown cheese cheesecake, homemade jam and cookie.  All divine and the smells of the cookies freshly made were to die for!  Last on the food stop we had hearty \"pub\" dish with meat and potatoes - so large I had to take some home!  Our very last stop was to sample 4 local beers.  Yum!

I was a little unsure at the small portions at first, but you visit so many places you wouldn't want to fill up early and not be ready for the next stop. A walking tour in a city that rains a lot, but we came prepared for the day with rain coats, and Cheyanne had extra umbrellas. What a fun tour that helped us see the city within easy walking distance.",

There was not a single \"dud\" in all the places we visited. Unique foods, comfort foods, fancy foods. All are included. \n\nIf you're lucky like we were, this will be the first time you try plukkfisk and it will be amazing. If you are not so lucky and have tried it elsewhere (we had a different version later in our vacation that was dreadful) take a chance and try what Cheyanne has arranged! I promise you will not be disappointed.\n\nHighly recommended. The food is wonderful, the tour both entertaining and interesting.",

Does a great job introducing and exploring Bergen’s food culture through unique tastings and captivating explanations.  The owner guide, Cheyenne is knowledgeable, funny and very expressive.  The tastings are all very good without exception and some are very unique to the point that I might not have tried them on my own but am glad that this tour provided our the chance.  There is a local fish soup that is chock full of fish and flavor that made me want to go back for more and the brown cheese cake is over the top.  Been on numerous food tours in cities around the world.  This tour ranks high on our list without reservation.",

That's the point of a food tour, to try things you normally might not taste. \n\nI highly recommend this tour as a way to spend your day in Bergen. You learn about the city while eating.",

We had a bright day which made it even nicer as the colors of the fjord and the villages were very vibrant.  It was an excellent way to see a fjord without a significant investment of time.",

We went out a lovely partly sunny May morning (on the 10:00 cruise) which was perfect weather for enjoying the cruise on the open upper deck. There is also an enclosed lower deck but if the weather is decent, the upper deck is definitely the place to experience the tour. \n\nWe really enjoyed the cruise. The boat was clean and well maintained and ran smoothly across the water. Once you get away from the more populated areas the scenery becomes magnificent. The fjord narrows and you pass between some very high cliffs. There are a few scattered houses along the way. Near the end of the cruise you also pass by and up close to some tall narrow waterfalls. Plenty of beautiful sights and lots of photo opportunities. \n\nIf you are traveling to the Bergen area, a fjord cruise should definitely be on your itinerary and the Rødne cruise is a good one to take. A true Norway experience!",

Once we rode a bit further, we saw tall snow-covered mountains, waterfalls, clear water, and beautiful views! It was very cold and windy on the top deck, so make sure to bring a lot of layers (I went in the beginning of March). You can sit inside, where it's warm, or on the first or second decks outside, where the views are much nicer. We passed by one waterfall and got to have a cup of fresh water from it, which was pretty cool. We saw lots of typical Norwegian-style houses in different colors, and it was breathtaking. Overall, I would definitely recommend this tour!",

As we came to the last part , that was really nice to see, but some nordic mystic music from speakers and pre-recorded texts were not realy fitting in this. That we stopped directly in front of the waterfall and we could also almost touch it , was nice. The only personal moment was at the glass of waterfall water was served. It would be actualy , in my opinion, very good tour, if we would stop somewhere and could go on lan (at least in Mostraumen), this way, was only a boat ride with some extras at the end.",

The three hour journey through the fjords was nothing short of amazing. I cannot put into words the magnificence of the places we saw. Massive rock collections, countless waterfalls, goats, Pulpit Rock, etc. This beautiful and brief journey has something for everyone. Don’t miss it, a spectacular trip offered by a professional company ",

Getting up early to get there as the sun comes up. Yup, taking an early morning cruise is highly recommended. Why?\n\nThe water is still. Almost like mirror. No ripples. You see the beauty twice over - once you look the reflection and raise your eyes to look up. Can you tell the difference? It is just that beautiful.  If you have not done anything else in Norway, this one thing is something you should never miss. If you have not planned on going here, you will miss something spectacular.\n\nHighly, highly recommended.",

There is a boat leaving at 10:00 AM and another one at 2:00 PM - we went with the morning one. It leaves just from the harbour in the old part of the city, next to the fish market. It is a very modern boat with sundeck, but there is also a place which is covered with glass and has chairs. The course goes all the way to Mo and back and offers some breathtaking views. Price was also acceptable, it costed 600 NOK per person.",

I did have to push my way through a big crowd on the top observation deck, just to get a few shot from the front. It felt like being in a New York City subway car during rush hour. It was however well worth it as I got one of my best shots from our whole two week trip. The crew was pleasant and helpful. If you got a day to kill in Bergen, this is a nice way to do it. I recommend this tour.",

It was a real treat to experience them all in one place, in a professional yet relaxed environment, and with the guidance of the knowledgeable team at Flow. They practice what they preach and therefore had the ability to guide, inform and encourage us. I especially enjoyed the deprivation tank, an hour of blissful peace with yourself - wish I had regular access to one!",

The staff gave us a very good intro to what to expect, knowledge and the service was great. My partner does not like small rooms and is a bit claustrophobic, but after the intro with the staff and a look at the facilities she was totally fine with the idea of getting in to the float tank. Both me and here had a amazing experience. I would defiantly recommend Flow State to everyone I meet. These guys know what they are doing and seem very in to their work.\n\nJust amazing.

      "text": "This had been suggested to me as a good way to try and relax my back, which I had recently injured.  Although skeptical at first I thought I'd give it a go when visiting Bergen for a weekend break. No such thing as float tanks where I live, so when in Rome and all that.  Popped past a walk in the morning just to see if there was any availability, luckily they could fit me in later that afternoon.  The actual experience is awesome. I would highly recommend giving it a try.  Felt like I was in there for 20 minutes, was the full hour.  I had no clue.  Most relaxed my body has ever felt.  This has got to be good for anyone, although I would suggest understanding how mediation works first as this will enhance the time spent floating.  Would highly recommend.",

      "text": "I've tried floating several times. The benefits and uses are many. For me it's about going deep and working on chronic stress and the psyche in general. As a physician I think this is a great tool. Lying like weightless in the tank you really get to feel all the muscle tensions, tensions you didn't even know you had, but that still can cause trouble down the road. In addition, if one options to close the tank and add sensory deprivation, it is a great tool to get to know ones own psyche. Describing the experience is of limited value, since I suspect this is different for everyone. Frode and Christoffer are wonderful, openminded people who doesn't shy away from a little chat after the sessions, sincerely interested in one's experience if one feels to share. They also offer light therapy and cryotherapy, which both are cutting edge tools. Flow State comes highly recommended, whether one is a resident of Bergen, or just visiting, looking for experiences.",

But after traveling with Bjorn and Norway Fjord travel ,I have to say that the best among others comes way behind Bjorn. He is undoubtedly the BEST.We always wanted to see Norway and our planning started in December. I had interacted with many guides but the moment I started my communication with Bjorn I knew that he is the right guy and after completing the tour I can confidently say that the end result is much beyond our expectations.\nI sent him our itinerary with my knowledge( acquired from the net)and he fine tuned it to suit us to have a good experience. He advised us regarding the hotels and in a couple of places ,where we could not get a proper accommodation ,he helped us to get accommodation for in good places. His knowledge of Norway is immense- be it scenic roads, view points, history, culture, economy . He drove us for 9 days from May 27 to June 4th through enchanting Norway. He knew the lesser travelled roads with stunning sceneries. In Bergen we went with him into the Fjords in a RIB. He took us through Fjords into which the big ships were not able  go. We had the greatest time of our  lives during that ride. We went literally under a waterfall. If it was not for him we would have missed out some incredible parts. He is punctual & jovial. He is observant and sensitive to the needs, comforts and discomforts of travelers and tries his best to make everyone comfortable and at ease . His commentary mixed with humor during the journey about the scenic landscapes, made the journey interesting. Norway is a very beautiful country with Fjords, mountains, waterfalls and the pleasure of seeing it enhanced many fold, thanks to Bjorn, Robert and Norway Fjord travel. ",

The survival suits are surprisingly comfortable, clean and keep you nice and warm! Bjorn knows this area like the back of his hand and it shows. Magical mystical scenery along unspoilt fjord waterways which gave all of us a sense of life in this beautiful but remote part of the world. Bjorn has a deep knowledge of Norwegian history, life and culture. We are all wildlife and bird enthusiasts - so Bjorn found wild swans, nesting gulls, swallows, and other bird life. All of us - including the three teenagers - give this trip an enthusiastic thumbs up!  A highlight of our visit to Bergen. ",

      "text": "We met at the benches in front of the tourist office & Frank, our guide, was carrying a sign for Norway Mountain Guides. I arrived early & was a little nervous as I was traveling alone, but was quickly put at ease. Frank was very friendly & after filling out the appropriate paperwork we walked across the street to purchase a ticket on the first bus to the Ulriken Funicular as well as a ticket for the Funicular itself. This bus & Funicular ride were an additional fee. I think it was roughly 100 kr. The hike can proceed from Mt. Ulriken to Mt. Floyen or from Floyen to Ulriken & Frank suggested that we start in Ulriken. We boarded the bus & shortly after we arrived at the Funicular. We boarded the Funicular & up we went to the start of the hike. The views already were beautiful. Once we began hiking though it became clear why this is the most popular hike in Bergen! The views & landscape were magnificent!! It was hard to believe that we were directly above Norway’s 2nd largest city as the terrain was untouched, pristine & gave the impression of being in the complete wilderness. There were mountain lakes to swim in & mountain streams to drink from, there were herds of sheep & lush farmland below & rocky & moss covered terrain on the trail which made it easy to understand how the legends of the trolls were born. Every turn offered a more beautiful view & truly was unbelievable! Although we saw very few people along the 13km route it did become more frequented as the day progressed. It was a confusing path that was marked by piles of stones & the occasional directional sign. I was very pleased to have Frank with us. He was incredibly pleasant, knowledgeable & amenable. His primary goal was to make sure that we enjoyed the trail. He adjusted the pace according to our needs-speeding up & slowing down according to the terrain. It was an incredibly long hike but I left wanting more. At no point was I ready for this trail with its remarkable views to come to an end. Furthermore, the lively discussions along the trail were almost as interesting as the views. Frank doubled as a history, economics & sociology professor as our group, entirely made up of Americans, peppered him with questions about the Vikings, World War II, healthcare, infrastructure, commerce & industry, kindercare, maternity & paternity leave, the environment, the government, natural resources-you name it. Frank earned his stripes & gave us all an incredible understanding of the history & present day Norway as well as a love of the landscape. It was an extraordinary day!! I highly recommend Frank & would have done every hike he offered, but sadly we had scheduling conflicts. Next time for sure!!!!",

We basically asked him every question under the sun during the leisurely almost full day hike and he was totally accommodating and was clearly very proud of his heritage. beautiful landscape and preservation of it. I would definitely recommend the hike and the flexibility offered makes it a good option for most as long as ypu have a decent fitness level. And bring layers!!",

      "text": "We had a terrific time today hiking the trails above Bergen with our wonderful guide from Norway Mountain Guides, Birgitte.   \n\nWe were initially unsure if we wanted to hike by ourselves or take advantage of a local guide.  We decided a couple of days prior to our hiking day to book a guide on line.  Signing up was quick and easy and we got an immediate confirmation.  \n\nWe met Birgitte on time at the designated time and place.  It started well as she greeted us with a big smile and quickly engaged us in conversations about what we want to do during our hike.  We proceeded up the funicular with her placing us for a good view for the quick ride up.  \n\nWe initially thought of hiking the Vidden trail but she mentioned that trail was very wet due to recent weather and that she would recommend her personal favorite trails that would provide very beautiful panoramic views.  We took her up on this recommendation and we were both very happy that we did.  We saw some terrific vistas and the various trails were in decent hiking condition.\n\nBirgitte also took good care of us.  She checked with us for any needed breaks, picked a picturesque mountain top for a lunch break and double checked that the trails were within our hiking ability.  \n\nWhat put the trip in a top category, was Birgitte’s friendly personality and her relating her experiences growing up in and around Bergen.  \n\nNorway Mountains Guides does recommend packing a knapsack for the changing weather in the area and the advice worked well.  Given all the special trails that we experienced, booking with Norway Mountain Guides turned out to be an excellent decision.  \n\nAll in all, a good day spent hiking!",

Frank took our group on a 30 minute drive to outside the city where we hiked along a local trail to see Osterfjord and Sørfjord. On our adventure, we only saw a few people who lived in the area. Frank was extremely knowledgable about the plant life and surrounding areas. Frank also was very good at pacing the group so that no one felt left behind or overly tired. Once we reached the top he had local snacks as well as things to sit on. He was extremely well prepared and some of the best hiking company I have ever had. I highly recommend booking with Frank!

If you are looking for an off-the-beaten-path hiking experience beloved by the locals, you MUST book with Norwegian Mountain Guides. Would give more than five stars if I could!

Snowshoe-ing was awesome and very manageable for people of various hiking skill levels. I am not too experienced in hiking--but Frank paced us well and I did just fine! At the top of the mountain, there was a small little red barn that we ate lunch at. Frank packed a traditional Norwegian snack (brown cheese and tea!). The brown cheese with buttered bread was so delicious--went to a grocery store and bought some for myself! Definitely would book with Frank again!!",

He picked us up by the harbor and gave us lots of wonderful insight into Norwegian culture and history on the 30min drive to Osterfjorden. We hiked first on foot, then switched to snowshoe for the last hour. Frank packed some great traditional Norwegian farm food, which we ate with a fantastic view of the fjord. The route was well off the beaten path, and we bumped into just one woman hiking with her dog, who mentioned that she rarely sees tourists in the area--so if you're looking to experience some alone time in the gorgeous Norwegian wilderness, look no further! Also, they offer a very nice student discount.",

As the group only consisted of 3 people, we got hands-on information and follow-ups. Although the weather was not great (foggy and rainy), we nonetheless had a nice trip and we gained valuable knowledge about ski touring. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who is new to ski touring!",

Nothing was too much trouble for Frank. He even brought along a packed lunch for us to sample typical Norwegian delicacies.\nWe ate lunch nearly at the top of the mountain where there was lots of snow and so peaceful, there was no one else around to spoil the peace and quiet.\nOnce we were back to the car and on the way home we even got to stop at a lovely waterfall that you could walk under without getting wet.\nFrank then drove us back to our hotel after a great day out.\nIf you’re looking for Snowshoe hiking, skiing, or hiking around Bergen then you couldn’t do better than hiring Frank to show you a good time as he’s extremely knowledgeable.\nOverall 10 out of 10. A superb day out.",

      "text": "I'm new to ski touring. My girlfriend and I wanted to experience the high mountains in Western Norway but we only had two days in Norway to do it. Our other goals were to see a glacier and a fjord. My guide Ole informed me that those goals are best experienced separately, skiing near the water isn't as nice due to the warm humid air that is generated by the sea. Skiing near the sea is best in there very far north of Norway. And glaciers are very remote in the southern part of Norway. Ultimately we focused on just the skiing. Ole organized two separate day tours in the Voss area. Each day we skinned from the car to the mountain ridge, then did some exploration and finally skied back to the car. On our second day we skied with a beautiful dog that lived at a local farm and makes his living showing skiers how to get to the summit and back safely in exchange for belly rubs and treats. Though we did not see fjords or glaciers from the slopes, Ole did drive me to Gudvangen to see Nærøyfjord, I appreciated the detour. Ole was knowledgable about the history of the area and most importantly about wilderness rescue based his resume of past courses. Fortunately, we never had to practice those skills. I found what he had to say about the Norwegian resistance in WWII fascinating. On our last day, my girlfriend took the train to Bergen to explore the art museums while we skied. Ole went above and beyond to drive me to Bergen to rendezvous with her. All in all it was a great experience, Ole was thurough in his planning and flexible with the plans when needed.",

I doubt I’d have learned anything about its Hanseatic history otherwise and that’s really the history of the city and Bryggen in particular. I also wouldn’t have known about the famous artists, certainly not much. \n\nI also enjoyed hearing about Martin’s personal experiences living in Norway as an immigrant and particularly about his time in the north just by the Russian border. \n\nThe walking is not very difficult with frequent (but not so frequent you feel “stuck” in an area) stops and Martin is deceptive to questions. I did the English tour and just like everyone else in Norway Martin is fluent. If you go with Martin you are in for a treat; we’re very glad we did! ",

The groups are held to 16 people max so it is quite personal and we had lots of opportunity to ask questions. He even sprinkled in some helpful tips (e.g., wait until after 3:00 to take the funicular after the cruise ships have left). Well worth the price. ",

Once we arrived we met our pilot Yngve and got our first glimpse of the beautiful red bird that would carry us through the skies.  We had booked the 90 minute Trolltounge tour, but there was bad weather approaching so we trusted Yngve to adjust our flight path to both keep us safe and wow us with beautiful sights.  He did not disappoint!  Thank you again Henry and Yngve, we loved every minute of our adventure!!",

Ingvar was an exceptional pilot with an excellent knowledge of the landscape and the various villages and Fjords we flew over.\n\nWe highly recommend Fonnafly and they will be our go to company next time we are in Norway!\n\nThanks to Ingvar and Damon for an excellent transport!",

Flew the fjords and up to the glacier.  The pilot (Kjell) had lots of experience and made it a great flight, pointing out interesting locations.  The time flew by (sorry for the pun) - we got to see Norway as few do.\n\nIts not an inexpensive outing, but is worth every penny: in part because when flying helicopters you want the best (not the cheapest!!), ands in part because it’s truly a once in a lifetime experience.\n\nHighly recommended, without reservation.",

Rain is common in Norway so bring good gear and some snacks as it is a full day. The food break during kayaking was very good and the guide was very informative and also gave good advice on a nice place to stop for a beer when they give you a ride back to Voss.  Remember its Norway active and not Norway coach potato so be prepared by having a good breakfast and bringing some snacks and water and read what they send you. A great value for the cost.",

      "title": "Worst organised tour. Poor value for money. ",
      "text": "I wanted give some feedback regarding the standard extra fjord tour that my friends and I participated in.\n\nWe were extremely disappointed by the level of organisation of this tour. Throughout the entire day we found ourselves confused due to the lack of communication from the company and found ourselves unprepared for the activities of the day. \n\nWe picked up our train tickets from Bergen the previous day to depart at 6.51am the day of the tour. Despite having read all the guidance materials we were shocked to discover that we wouldn’t have a chance to eat anything until 3.30pm. This is completely unreasonable and a prime example of a poorly structured tour experience. \n\nWe’d have happily purchased some food in Flam but did not have a chance as we were told we were late to each place and asked to rush from one activity to the other. After meeting our “guide” in Berkevam we were assigned our bikes and given some vague instructions on how to get to the meeting point in Flam. However we didn’t receive any further information on how the day would be structured/how we would be transported or how we’d collect our luggage. The lack of direction from the guide was appalling. \n\nUpon arrival in Flam we were pointed in the direction of the Fjord Safari, again, with very little information or communication.\n\nThe worst part was when we finished the fjord safari, now starving, and were told we didn’t even have time to go to the toilet because we were late to the kayak briefing. The kayak instructor was initially quite annoyed that we were late - even though this was in no way our fault. He was more understanding when he realised it was Norway Active guide that delivered us late and gave us zero guidance.  \n\nWe were in no way prepared for the kayak expedition (as no information on what to wear/bring along was provided). By the time we started we were wet and hungry - definitely not how you want to feel after spending so much money. \n\nThe kayak instructor pulled us over for the “BBQ lunch” we were told we’d receive which turned out to be some grilled chicken on a portable cooker and some wraps with a few cookies. We would have been fine with this food, however what we don’t appreciate is the misleading information from the organisation that a BBQ lunch would be included. \n\nEven the final leg of the journey for us (to get back to Voss) was not at all clear as we were told we’d get a mini van but had no idea with who or where to meet them. Even the tour instructor who suggested we take their van back to Voss didn’t seem to know they were responsible for us. We only found out our luggage had been stored in a specific place because our friend went hunting for it. \n\nMy understanding of this tour service is that they assist us with aggregating these activities from different tour providers, yet we were made to feel like it was our fault for being late or not eating - even though this was due to poor organisation from their team. I actually don’t have any complaints to each of the individual operators of the tours - only with Norway Active’  service which was to help us organise the day smoothly. \n\nThis activity was by no means a cheap one for us and for what we paid we expected an exceptional standard. In Australian dollars this was over $500!!!  What we received was completely underwhelming. \n\nI wrote this feedback to the company as they asked for it and their response was equally terrible. Defensive response written in barely discernible English. They passed blame to all their operators and told me they don’t normally get complaints implying it was our fault. \n\nSave your money and don’t use them! ",

Because no one else wanted to do rafting on the same day as me I had to switch my day, that's fine I didn't mind but I asked if I could switch my tour to a completely different day and Knut (the booking manager) has a habit of not answering every question if you send multiple in an email an he also doesn't proofread his emails before sending them so if you ask the same question more than once he gets annoyed at you. I asked if I could switch the day of my tour he did answer but I couldn't understand what he said so I asked again and he sent a very passive aggressive email that was not appreciated. Also I was under the impression that the bike tour was to be guided and it wasn't and the directions were vague. We didn't get any time in the Viking village which was disappointing. All my complaints aside I would definitely do the tour again, I did have a blast.",

The walls were thick stone.\n\nThe room light was low with the pleasant ambience of candlelight.\n\nWe felt like we were back in medieval times.\n\nWe ordered a beer. I recommend the local Hansa beer.\n\nThe bartender explained the history of the pub to us while she worked.\n\nA special thank you to her for making our afternoon there memorable.\n\nThis is the oldest remaining pub in Bergen, and a definite ‘must see’ for history lovers. \n\nI highly recommend a visit to this pub if you have time!",

Since my maternal grandfather (morfar) grew up on such a farm before emigrating to Minnesota in the 1880s, I found the discussion of farm life extremely interesting. We were told about both their horse and sheep operations. Then we went into the house for lunch.  I very much enjoyed the lunch. \n\nTowards the end of the lunch one of our hostesses came into the dinning room dressed in her traditional dress (Bunad). Among other items she told us how their stocking color revealed marital status. I would have liked to have included picture of her but she requested I did not.\n\nI was also very impressed by the young student groups who were leaving the farm as we were arriving. I was particularly surprised to see the diversity of the children.",

He explained that farms in Norway are controlled and subsidized by the government, depending upon needs.  He served our group delicious apple and raspberry cider before taking us to an older house on the property where he served tea, coffee and hot chocolate, along with delicious pastries, some of which he made himself.  We were treated to an explanation of the traditional Norwegian costumes which he modeled for us and then he played a tune from the piano and danced a bit.  Quite a charming farmer and a very interesting tour.  I enjoyed hearing this thoughts on the economy and his interest in everything from farming to the price of oil, etc.  A very relaxing trip near the end of our cruise.

The owner was quite entertaining himself. He was asked where his greatest source of income was and he said ‘Trafalger’. I was on a Trafalger tour of the Scandinavian countries. The Raspberry apple cider was delicious. Entering the house we experienced a beautiful evening. The table settings were lovely and the Norwegian food delicious. Later the owner and girl servers dressed in authentic Norwegian costumes and the owner played the piano. What a fabulous experience. We were made to feel warm and inviting. ",

A short walk took us to his main \"crop\", sheep. The whole herd came running to meet us! We learned a lot about raising sheep. We went into a barn where we enjoyed Raspberry Juice, and he answered questions about life on the farm and Norway in general. We then moved to the main house for coffee and delicious pastries made by him. We saw several national costumes and were treated to a short piano recital of a piece by Grieg. The farm sits by a lake so the setting was idyllic. Overall it was very enjoyable and educational.",

To be fair Susan Fosse have a good product but I think it's not even close to Dale neither in design nor in quality. And their prices are not that much better. Besides prices in Bergen tend to be higher than in other parts of the country. We made most of our sweater purchases in Trondheim and Alesund at 40 to 50% discount.",

Susan’s knowledge of the styling, fit and function of each of her individually designed knitwear pieces allowed me to purchase two very different sweaters which I am looking forward to wearing as soon as we get cold weather. The items are beautiful and unique and they will be wonderful mementos of our visit to Bergen and our visit to Susan’s store.",

Although the shop can be hard to find using Google Maps (tip: it's down an alleyway between the historic buildings in the harbour district), it's worth the effort. Susan's sweaters (and scarves and mittens and headbands!) are gorgeous and beautifully crafted, combining traditional Nordic patterns with a unique artistic point of view. Susan's mother was working in the shop during our visit, and she was a delight: friendly and welcoming and knowledgeable. We were lucky enough to meet Susan just as we were checking out and so had an opportunity to tell her how much we loved her work. The only challenge you'll have is deciding on which of the beautiful pieces you'll want to take home. We'll cherish our sweaters as souvenirs of our time in Bergen.",

There are two interior decks. A cafeteria serves mostly snack food. There is a dedicated play area for children. The seas might be a little rough at times but generally we had okay to good weather. Most seating was forward but there were some areas with tables. You could take in the pure air on the outer deck.  The television screen closest to where I was sitting did not work. It was showing mostly the route. I was not able to connect to the wifi at all while others said it was quite slow. I was going from Flam to Bergen so this option is a) more expensive than land transportation and b) takes more than twice as long as overland. If you have the time and like the open water, consider this route.",

The staff leading the cruise was rude and unfriendly the majority of the time, making it an altogether unpleasant experience. we also paid for the additional nature museum and waterfall hike and again, definitely not worth the price tag. the museum was overall not engaging and was a waste of time, the cafe across the street was full of cheap souvenir gifts and there wasn’t enough time to eat, even if you hadn’t eaten all day. the time at the waterfall was pitifully short, and we had hardly any time to explore at all.",

Ferry was great, saw a lot, enough commentary, food available at kiosk on board was good. Very comfy trip. Fiord was just beautiful. Both in rain and mist, and when the sun came out pm. 8am from Bergen, several stops at quaint towns, Flam about 1 pm, which gave us time to look around before staying the night in the lovely hotel. All booked on line.",

      "text": "My journey from Bergen to Sognefjord was the highlight of my Norway trip.  The boat was very comfortable, I spent a couple of minutes in the seat and then was out on deck for about five and a half hours making the most of the stunning scenery.  The boat was very comfortable fast and as it was relatively small it went through some very narrow channels which added to the enjoyment.  It provides a great public service, stopping at some quite small places but there is also commentary about places of interest along the route and this plus the stops to see the waterfalls add so much more.  The boat was of course in immaculate condition and the crew really helpful and pleasant in the way that they dealt with the passengers.  If visiting Bergen this is a must do and if not visit Bergen for this trip.  Well done and thank you Norled for such an outstanding service.",

The views were still spectacular, especially during the last two hours of the trip, when the mountains rise almost vertically from the sea. The boat actually did a 360 degree pivot to give everyone on board a thorough of a particularly famous waterfall. \nHint: get on the boat as early as possible--the window seats and front row fill up fast.\nFlan was surprising. More of a destination than we expected--there are several hotels and even a bit of shopping. The half-hour train ride to Mayen has more spectacular vistas, The train itself is kind of an antique, but in very good condition. There's one stop where everyone disembarks at a waterfall. A stone ruin overlooks the viewing platform, and a Norse maiden does an ethereal dance to some slightly spooky music. Nice interlude. \nFrom Mayen back to Bergen is around 2 hours on a modern, comfortable train. Again, seating can be tight when it's crowded.\n\nAll in all worth the price (around $175US pp at the time we booked it), but be prepared to make a day of it. We left Bergen at 8AM and returned to the railway station just before 6PM.  \nIt's better to pick a sunny day, of course, but those can be difficult to predict in Norway. ",

It is a long trip of some seven plus hours, making it worthwhile to consider an upgrade to the comfort class carriages, offering free coffee. You will appreciate it more reading up on the engineering feat just to build the highest journey in Scandinavia. Completed in 1909 after thirty four years of work, there are over 180 tunnels. When not in one of them, there are glacial waters, rustic scenery and a good deal of very small town living. The train connects to the famed Flam Railway at Myrdal, the line climbing to 1,222 meters. As a passenger train, it may be late, always playing second fiddle to commercial freight trains. Train shots are only so good due to movement so the trip is best appreciated putting the camera down to look upon the bounty of Mother Nature.",

The train stations on either end are very centrally located in the hearts of both Bergen and Oslo. Norway is such a beautiful country and this is a lovely way to see a lot of the countryside. The scenery along the way is spectacular as you experience much of Norway’s natural beauty.  \n\nI recommend paying the extra 100 NOK for the Komfort car where there is extra leg room and small tables for all seats. It was very comfortable. \n\nOn the trip to Oslo, I recommend seats on the right side of the car (when facing the direction of travel). While there are enjoyable views on both sides, the most spectacular scenery is on the right side. This includes beautiful mountains, lakes, rivers and glaciers. The Vy website is very good and makes it easy to select the seats you want. \n\n",

We flew to Oslo, spent one night, then caught the train at about 3pm. It got into Bergen late, but it was still light. The first hour or so is suburban and not very interesting. But the next 6 or so hours makes up for it. In late May there was still lots of snow on the mountains and wonderful waterfalls. The only downside is the food; if you think you might be hungry, pack a picnic ",

      "text": "I booked the Norway in a Nutshell from a friend's recommendation and never really looked into what it was all about.  I was so pleasantly surprised by the efficiency of the Norwegian transit system.  The commuter train from Bergen to Voss left right on time (make sure to use the restroom on the train because there is no time in Voss and there is no restroom on the bus!).  The bus to Gudvangen was an experience with roughly 10 very tight switch backs on an 18% gradient with exquisite waterfalls from start to finish.  The ferry from Gudvangen to Flam was our favorite part of the trip.  It's on an electric ferry that is so quiet and relaxing with the best opportunities for pictures.  Then you get on a scenic train that brings you up into the mountains. We were there at the end of the May and it was snowing so dress warm.  Also, have a quick layover at Myrdal because it is tiny with one little cafe and not much to see or do especially because it's freezing!  The final part of the journey is by train and lasts roughly 4 hours.  We splurged for the first class seats and it was great with lots of room and very comfortable seats.  There wasn't food or beverage service (I was surprised by this) but the bar car had food and beverages.  Don't wait until the last minute if you are hungry because they run out of food.  As an FYI - all alcoholic beverages must be consumed in the bar car and not at your seat.  It was a fun adventure!",

      "text": "We travelled on this train with my elderly mother-in-law after arriving in Bergen on the Hurtigruten coastal cruise from Kirkenes. I have given 4 stars primarily for the scenery however the Norwegian trains need a big redesign.\n\nThe first strange and irritating thing you will find is the number of steps into the carriage from the platform. Why I ask? The carriage lines up with the platform but you need to step up into the seating area and lugging baggage makes it difficult for the elderly. No problem for the young and able bodied but I can’t see and reason for it.\n\nSecond issue is the permanently fixed table along each of the two seats. There is ample leg room which is great but then the designer thought placing a permanent table with a very large thick center leg makes it very cumbersome to move along to the window seat and I would think this would be a major issue if needing to vacate the seat due to an emergency. They advertise that these trains are great for using a laptop to do work but the table is useless and inconvenient for anything else. \n\nThird issue is that each side of the carriage faces the opposite direction. Which means half the passengers are traveling backwards and the seats can’t be turned around. Very strange. \n\nFourth issue is that when selecting seats online don’t expect the seats to face the way shown on the online diagram. I was expecting to travel backwards but the seats were facing forward. No problem for me but it would be a shock for those on the other side of the carriage that were expecting to travel forward but ended up traveling backwards.\n\nAlthough there were issues with the train (besides also being delayed) the scenery was spectacular and I didn’t find the cost expensive at all. \n\nI would highly recommend the trip just for the scenery as it goes up onto the top of the mountain range in amongst the ski resorts.",

We also saw the sun rise at about 9 am over hills and water. Cue Edward Grieg. Breathtaking. \nComforts on board include quiet, stable carriages, (including a dedicated children’s carriage with a playroom and secure locking devices), friendly and helpful staff, clean toilet facilities, and a quite well stocked dining car. We paid extra for the Komfort class, in which the seats reclined comfortably. There was plants of storage. Why can’t train travel be like this everywhere? It was exceptional. Highly recommended. \nYou could break this trip to catch the Fløm railway and then continue your journey if you want.",

We made sure we boarded first train (your particular carriage#) as soon as possible, found luggage compartments just inside, rolled cases in, found our assigned seats few rows away. Perfect! Was a little dark first leg. Next train same, although no assigned seats. Bus ride cases went under bus, nearly everyone had cases!! Nice bus commentary as we passed the most spectacular scenery. Ferry we left cases (with all others) downstairs, proceeded upstairs, all good. Then last 2 trains same as above, last train being assigned seats. Yes, we had cases but certainly did manage fine. We are mid 50's. Don't stress! Enjoy!",

The first hour or so most of the scenic action is on the right side of the train as it follows a river up into the mountains. Once in the mountains though the left side gets all the really exciting views. \nWe went first class, the seats were terrific and we had loads of space. The tinted windows are large and there are several windows without passenger seats so it is easy to go to the other side to capture the view. There was also free tea, coffee and hot chocolate throughout the journey. \nIf you have time, end your journey at Myrdal and catch the Flamsbana train to Flam, stay overnight and then catch a ferry from Flam to Bergen along the fjord. The Flamsbana Train trip is more spectacular than the Oslo/Bergen and Flam is gorgeous. ",

We kinda suspected that it would be a bit overpriced and not much to see but went there anyway, since we had seen most other sights. We had our included drink and was there for like 20-25 minutes, but the entrance was not worth it, really. Maybe you appreciate it more when you have already had a few drinks and are out doing several pubs already on a Friday or so.",

The girl at the counter said there were “some ice blocks” inside for remodelling work. When we went in (9 pm) the room was small & you could see all the sculptures that were there from the door. (There weren’t many) The ice blocks took up a lot of the space & meant there was VERY little to see..except for a lot of blocks of ice!!!  In 2 minutes you had seen everything. Other than us there were only two people & the barmaid  present! We had our (included) drink & left after 15 mins. This was the worst experience whilst in Norway by far!! \nIn fairness, having remonstrated with the girl at the door & demanding to see the manager, she finally relented & I received a sizeable refund. But, quite simply, they should NOT have been open to the public as the place was basically a storage unit for ice blocks with nothing of note to see!\nQuite simply if in Bergen don’t waste your time here...unfortunately we did!!!!\nBaffles me how someone could ever give a 4/5 star review.\n",

A bonus was that we went early for in the evening - missing the cruise ship crowds and the young party goers - for most of the time we were the only ones there; giving us a great opportunity to move around and see all the sculptures as the lighting changed.

Of course there are ice bars but this is an ice bar in the right location.   It's like most ice bars and very cold but totally enjoyable.   I would recommend the second ticket option they have on their list as not only do you get a free drink in the bar but also a free cocktail of your choice and given Norways sky high prices for drinks, this is very good value.   We stayed about an hour and then walked back to the hotel (in what felt like a sub-tropical 3 degree temperature after being in the bar).    Ice scupltures are interesting!   Not a big place though but a great place to go and recommended.",

Of all places, this first experience took place at Magic Ice in Bergen, Norway.  Our timing was perfect because we beat all the cruise ship tourists so no waiting!  \n\nHad a super FUN experience!!  After putting on one of their ponchos, into the freezer we went!!  As expected, there were plenty of ice sculptures.  All the walls, seating areas, shelvings, bar, etc. were made out ice!!  Oh yeah, it was very chilly inside as well!  Most folks weren't staying too long inside the ice bar before leaving for the warmth outside.\n\nI enjoyed everything about the visit.  The ice sculptures were creative.  Especially the frame where you can poke your head through, and the throne where you can have a seat!!  The Norwegian alcoholic drink (cannot recall the name) which was included with the entry price was quite good.  Drinking it from the frozen ice glass made it even more chilling!!\n\nPrices for the various packages were very reasonable.  Staff was terrific.  There shop even sells affordable Norwegian souvenirs.",

Outfitted with large thermal Parka to wear over your clothes and warm gloves into the freezer you go.\n\nYour free welcome drink can be ordered from the bar, which is served in an edible ice glass, in a holder for convenience.  \n\nThe sculpting is very well done, with some items you can take pictures with your family on/in.\n\nNormally there is a time limit due to numbers of people wanting to visit.  However, we arrived as the last organised cruise group arrived in the early afternoon, and were allowed as much time as we desired.\n\nNice to visit once, but doubtful we would do it again.",

You pay a lot, get a thermal parka, gloves and a drink of some sweet national wine. There are some interesting ice sculptures and throne chair. Benches out of ice around the edge of the room. Located on the edge of town in the port area. Worth doing once so we can say we have, but we certainly don’t need to visit this location again.",

It was very organised our tickets included a drink be it alcoholic or soft drinks we all chose soft drinks. Before going in staff helped us to get on ponchos which were incredibly warm and we were given gloves to wear. The sculptures and the designs were very clever. Well worth the experience. ",

The bar is not too big, so I would imagine there is some control on how many go inside.

It wasn’t busy and no need to book. We did discover that in Norway they are not allowed to serve alcohol before midday so if we had gone when it opened at 11am we would not have been able to have any alcoholic drink despite the ticket price being the same.\nThe staff were very friendly and attentive. We were provided with well padded ponchos and gloves and it was really cold in there so dress appropriately! The ice carvings and sculptures were really good. I had expected the place to be bigger but there were still several booths which each had ice carvings as well as there being sculptures around and a big ice chair which guests can sit on. We paid for the second drink - it didn’t add much to the overall cost but if we hadn’t have already paid for it we might not have bothered as we were quite cold and we went back into reception for a warm up before going back in which apparently very common and perfectly acceptable.\nAll in all it was an interesting and fun experience.",

      "text": "We booked this tour for a group of six people (four adults and two children).\n\nIf you book in advance the first train ride has assigned seats but be prepared to race the crowd to the busses and get split apart between buses.  The busses are packed full and I ended up getting a broken \"Jump seat\" in the wheelchair cove of the bus.  My kids were stuck in the middle seats on the back of the bus and literally fell asleep as they did not get a chance to see anything from their position.\n\nNext comes a ferry ride that is again open seating.  The ferry is all electric and very nice but you are lucky if you get a seat on the 2+ hour ride.  This is about the only opportunity to really see anything as you can walk out on the open deck and take pictures of the Fjord.  I would recommend just doing the ferry ride and skipping the rest of the tour.\n\nThe ferry drops you off in Flam which is a complete tourist trap.  You can shop and stroll around but you better get in line early as the next train is open seating.  If you are a couple it is probably fine but we had difficulty finding seats and could not sit near our in laws.  The train is not air conditioned so it was quite stuffy on the warm summer day that we were there.\n\nThe final train had assigned seats and actually had some of the best views of the trip.  If you are a photographer this trip will frustrate you as there is glare from the train windows so you will not be able to get any good pictures during the trip.\n\nOverall I would not recommend for groups over four people.  The tour is fast paced but still boring.  The logistics were chaotic and stressful.",

      "text": "Took the Norway in a nutshell tour, which includes train, cruise and bus rides and started our trip in Bergen. We first took the train ride which was smooth and the views offered were superb. The 2 hours cruise from Flåm was rather boring albeit the (repetitive) scenic views. Before boarding the cruise, our rather long wait (4hours) at Flåm was also dull. As I believe it’s catered to predominantly tourists, souvenirs and food stores set up sell reallyyyy expensive food. During the wait, we simply bask in the sun and spent 2 hours napping on the grass since the sun was out and the weather was perfect to sleep in. Not far out in the corner, a kayak rental store is available but I think you have to catch certain time slots in order to row into the waters with the instructors.\n\nFinally, the 1 hour bus ride to Myriad to catch the train back to Bergen was the least enjoyable- views are nice but again, repetitive to a point where you’d doze off. Think this package would best suit retirees who want to enjoy what nature offers while sipping a cup of coffee; not so much to millennials who want to spend their time productively.",

The boat has a front deck with very little space for people. The big deck is at the back (where passengers are allowed to smoke; albeit just a few). Everyone on this boat LOVES waterfalls. When you hit the waterfall, everyone is at the back taking pics with their phone. There is a small cafe on the boat. The beauty around the water is great but is best in the last hour of the boat ride. Once in Flam, you take the Flam railway, which is an old style rail-car that is cool! Some of the trips were booked so buy in advance if you can. After the Flam railway is the Tram to Bergen. All of the tour is on public transportation so you could do this cheaper if you bought tickets individually, but honestly, it was worth it to me to have all the tickets in advance and hop from boat to train to tram without worry. In the end, it was great to see the Norwegian landscape during a short stay in Norway.",

We disembarked from the train from Bergen at 09:53 on May 11 in Voss station.  We walked to the bus stop as indicated in the travel plan AND THE PDF and waited for bus 990 to take us to Ulvik (change at Granvin to use 945).  The bus was supposed to leave for Granvin at 10:05.

We got stuck in Ulvik and waited for the 15:15 boat to take us to Norheimsund where  the bus would take us back to Bergen.  \n\nThe problem is they do not have a customer hotline number and a Saturday as their office is closed on the weekends.\n\nThis was supposed to be a memorable trip for us but it ended up partly affecting my positive impression of this beautiful and friendly people of Norway.",

      "title": "Awesome tour, including a very convenient mistake",
      "text": "We went on the Sognefjord & Nærøyfjord in a nutshell tour. \n\nWe started in Bergen. After a day getting used to our surroundings, we embarked from Bergen train station. We left the majority of our luggage in the lockers which are relatively cheap and I would advise you do the same. We had planned a single overnight stay so we didn't need to carry all that much. \n\nThe train to Voss was amazing, there wasn't a single bad view. Both sides of the train are as good as each other. I would recommend getting to Bergen train station early as the queue was massively long and we had to walk up the carriage to find two seats together. It wasn't overcrowded, but I'd suggest getting yourself comfortable before you get going.\n\nAt Voss, we were met by many tour buses to take everyone to Gudvangen. Again, go for the buses at the back. All the tourists seemed in a major hurry and crowded to the front buses in a big old hurry. As a result they looked really full. Ours was just over half full and far more pleasant. The trip down the Stalheimskleiv road is incredible! Amazing bus driving skills for sure; our bus driver deftly navigated her way around at least two cars parked in very silly ways. But the views of the waterfalls and cliffsides are majestic. This part of the tour is simply incredible.\n\nWe decided to spend our overnight in the Gudvangen hotel. Although (in 2018) the place felt a little unfinished, once the gaggle of tourists had headed off on the boat to continue their tour, it was very quiet, serene and picturesque. The rooms are really well laid out and decorated with Viking accoutrements throughout. Over the bridge was the Viking museum which was sadly still being built when we were there. However there are plenty pleasant walkways leading away from the hotel. The food hall and gift shops were brilliant and a perfect place to grab a souvenir if you aren't too fussed about the authenticity in terms of mass manufactured. There is a really sweet little pebble shop in Gudvangen where my partner decided to stock up on gifts for her daughter. They really were very pretty.\n\nWe could see that there were caves nearby, however it didn't seem that there was any reasonable way of accessing them for a visit. In my opinion, this is a very missed opportunity by the Gudvangen hotel as I would have loved to have gone.\n\nThe night in Gudvangen was excellent, we slept well and got a decent breakfast before making our way to the boat onto the Nærøyfjord. As well as scenery, there is plenty of sea life popping up to say hello and a little cafe on board to grab a coffee. This was a long part of the cruise and while picturesque, I would suggest that the boat itself isn't the most comfortable in the world. But it's a good time to sit back, relax and chat. \n\nArriving in Sogndal, we took a series of buses to make it over to Leikanger for the expressboat on the Sognefjord. However, this is where we made a mistake. We sadly got off of the bus too early and ended up being about a 20 minute walk from Leikanger for an express boat that was due to show up in far less time than that. Upon arrival, of course the boat had left and we were technically stranded. Hot tip, when the bus sign shows Leikanger, this isn't your stop. You need Leikanger Kei! If in doubt ask the driver; the second bus we got the driver was very helpful and sympathetic to our plight.\n\nThe hotel right by the Leikanger Kei had a room left which is where we spent the night, phoning ahead to our next night's hotel to cancel. As it turned out the hotel ahead only charged half of our missed night as they had a last minute guest pop in. Lovely people, the Norwegians and beats having had to pay out full costs.\n\nI have to say, the mistake actually turned out good. The hotel in Leikanger Kei is amazing. It overlooks the Kei with the mountains in the background. I'll warn, there is absolutely nothing in Leikanger other than a small churchyard that we found ourselves in with some sort of significance. But really the views available from the hotel were definitely the highlight of the trip. If I were doing this again, I would actually take the night in Leikanger Kei. It a really nice chilled out stop over, the food available is really good and it doesn't cost the earth. \n\nThe next morning we got our express boat back to Bergen and realised that had we left on boat the previous afternoon, chances are it would have been dark and we would have missed the amazing scenery down Sognefjord. Hence, if you can, catch a morning boat trip! The expressboat is also seriously comfortable and if you fancy a nap, now's your time. You have plenty time and the scenery down the fjord is awesome! I would suggest bringing snacks and/or coffee in a thermos!\n\nI loved the trip so much, we are intending on doing it again (albeit a slight variation) next year. Now that I have done it once, I would do the following in preparation:\n\n- Arm yourself with a coffee flask and buy sandwiches in Bergen before you go. Once in Gudvangen, pretty much everyone is stacked by the food hall to buy lunch and it's a nightmare. It reminded me of the black friday sales footage. This is an ideal time to sit by the lock or on the little island across the bridge and have your own lunch and then wander around the gift shops.\n\n- Our trip next year looks like we will be stopping in Sogndal. From the few minutes I saw Sogndal, it did look a lot better kitted out in terms of things to do and see. Although the Gudvangen hotel was beautiful (and I hope it's finished now) I think I would opt for Sogndal just to see the difference for myself. Again, stock up on coffee and lunches for the next day too!\n\n- Leaving the bulk of our luggage in the train station locker was a good plan! Travel light. While you can feasibly take it all with you, it's just a pain in the behind to be that guy lugging all your gear on every step. A simple rucksack with a couple of days changes in is all you need.\n\n- Definitely try and organise your trip so that the Sognefjord express boat is a morning boat. By the time 6pm rolled around, it was quite dark and I imagine would have been even darker on the Expressboat. The Sognefjord is far too pleasant to miss!\n\n- I fully recommend boots for the trip! I'm glad I had mine as did my partner as you will most likely want to go hiking or rambling. The terrain is not too friendly to light shoes or canvass shoes (just something I remember some guy on the tour moaning about)\n\n- Bring a zip hoodie or a fleece with you; the boat on the Nærøyfjord can get a little cold. Basically something with a hood that you can stash easily when you don't want it. \n\n- Where you get the opportunity, fill up your water and/or your coffee flask. You will thank yourself later!",

Everything ran exactly on time (unlike trains in the UK!) as your agenda shows you. Between stops and change overs it was easy and ran smoothly. The fact that it was a self tour actually made the whole day very relaxing. \nThe scenery is breathtaking, we were very lucky to not have a cloud in the sky on a cold, snowy day, however these views even on a miserable day would look stunning! \nAll transport was clean, the staff were friendly and were there if you needed to ask any questions. \nIt’s a great way to see Norway in a snap shot if you are only there for a short period of time. \nWe took a picnic with us for the day as we travelled in winter time so wasn’t sure what would be open, however there are cafes along the way with time to grab something to eat/drink even in these periods. \nSailing down the fjord is simply stunning and the caption ‘one of the worlds most beautiful train journeys’ on the Flåm railway wasn’t lying! I couldn’t recommend this trip enough! Well worth the money. ",

This is a self guided tour and yes, you can book each section on your own and probably save about 1/3 in cost, but for the ease (collecting all the tickets in 1 place) and organisation of connections I think it is was worth it and it all worked. The normal Oslo-Bergen railway sections are fine, nice scenery from Oslo towards Flam, but nothing spectacular.  The highlight begins with the Flam railway which is a great adventure although there was a lot of mist and we sadly missed some of the spectacular views.  Flam in mid winter is a surreal place to visit and well worth the overnight stop over particularly as it means you can do the whole trip in day light. The fjord journey the next day from Flam to Gudvangen was spectacular.  There were only about a dozen of us on a large new stealth like electric boat they have doing the route.  Really incredible.  Apart from the scenery, it was interesting to see how people live out in these remote parts with the boat acting as postman and transport.  Finally connection by bus to Voss and onwards to Bergen by train.  All in all an incredible trip and if you don't want to go to the time and agro of finding and booking each section yourself, then booking the whole thing through Fjord tours is an excellent option.",

      "text": "2140 NOK ($350+US) for 1-day unguided tour on public transport. Problem is, some 'new automated' seat selection that gave me not only the worst seat on the 'comfort' carriage (you pay more and it is the only reservable part of the trip). I can see the whole rest of the train is empty, but both Fjord tours and NSB (train) will not lift a finger to assign me a seat I can sit in (i.e. not a backward facing one). Not only zero customer service for a tour you can put together on your own, they are discriminating against a person with a medical disability, rather than simply issuing a forward facing seat. I asked them to refund that portion of the journey and I would go into the NSB web site and select the seat, but they wont do that, either. What a racket. Should have just booked it on my own. Waste of time and money. Save yourself a lot of aggravation and just make your own arrangements per the many DIY Norway in a Nutshell blogger articles. P.s. This trip is scheduled for March 2019 so perhaps with another 3 months of time and effort and VISA, tourism agency, etc. involvement it can be fixed by then. Hope you have lots of time on your hands!!!",

This time can easily be filled taking in the scenery. There is a shop and café also. Several braziers were lit outside too if you felt chilly. Our tour used the winter Classic boat, which whilst not modern has a lot of charm. There is lots of outside seating and deck space however inside is small and tired. The fjord is stunning, the water is like a mirror glass.  Flam is beautiful although there is not much time to explore it. I would advise boarding the train early to get a seat on the right for the best views. The sun went down on the journey back to Bergen with the best views from the left.",

Still, there are things a person should be prepared for:  (1) Bergen train station was quaint, but standing in a large crowd waiting to board the train was not fun; (2) While they are redoing the transportation center in Voss, right now walking from the train to the buses with a few pieces of luggage is also not fun; (3) Waiting to board the ferry outside on the dock would normally be okay, but if there is a drenching downpour like we had, you better have an umbrella; and (4) If you are booking online have the tickets sent to you rather than electing  to pick them up at the train station which was a bother and necessitated a taxi ride.  The ferry ride on the fjord was beautiful, with the ferry slowing down at major waterfalls.  Flåm is quite lovely and in a beautiful location, but expect a lot of people and tour busses.  The train ride to Myrdal IS the most beautiful ride in the world.  You need to do this if you are visiting Norway!",

We started off this journey on a rather long train ride from Oslo, but the further out into the country you get, the more beautiful the scenery becomes.  Each one of the stops is very convenient, well marked and easy to navigate.  It's also very convenient that no long distances are required to be walked, making it very easy to travel with your luggage.  We took the train from Myrdal down the mountain to Flam, an absolutely stunning ride where they stop and let the guests get off and see one of the larger waterfalls.  \n\nWe chose to do the premium boat cruise tour and loved it.  The boat was very nice, premium seating and plenty of outdoor space for everyone on board to sight see.  \n\nAfter that, the bus ride back to the next train was nice- although I didn't read closely enough that they take you up a huge mountain so they can bring you down a road with about 13 switchbacks... that was quite a ride.  If you have any fears of heights, don't sit near the front of the bus!  \n\nThis was a long day that got us into Bergen at about 9pm, but we enjoyed it very much even though it was technically a \"travel\" day. Couldn't recommend this more, they make planning so easy!",

      "text": "There are many options for tours - active or more relaxing, but I chose the kayaing tour out of Bergen.  You can book online at fjordtours.com or at the visitor center near the wharf.\n\nThe tour company picks you up outside the visitor center at 9:30am and the mini bus takes you 45 mins north to Herdla. You park at a house where they have you sign forms and change into kayak gear. They provide all of the outwear you need and many layers of waterproof gear, so just wear something comfortable for the bus ride, and if it's super cold, maybe a wool base layer.  \n\nWe happened to have a mild sunny day, but they provide neoprene booties, a sleeveless wetsuit, neoprene shirt, and a really nice kayaking windbreaker. you are on open water the whole tour.\n\nThey have mini lockers for valuables, and you leave your clothes in a dressing room. Bring dry underclothes for after the tour because yours will be wet and you’ll want a fresh set when you’re putting dry clothes back on. They have showers and towels too.\n\nOnce you are suited up you gather your kayak “skirt” dry bag and paddle to walk down to the beach. It’s about half a mile through a private farm, with breathtaking views of the water. On the beach there’s a quick tutorial and then you get into tandem kayaks. The site doesn’t say this anywhere but there are no single kayaks, except for the guide. \n\nThe kayaks are beautiful high quality sea kayaks- nicest I’ve ever been in and made in Norway. Depending on weather and the speed of the group you are with you navigate around islands and stop for lunch. The tour company provides sandwiches and a delicious locally made apple juice. Gluten free requests were not met, so bring food in your dry bag if you have food allergies.  They do provide dry bags that you can keep in your boat storage area. \n\nAfter lunch, if there’s time, you visit an old tunnel on one of the beaches (the entire area was used as a base and a fort at one time), and then you head back to shore. The experience is very weather dependent, but the views are spectacular and on a clear day you can see all the way to the North Sea. The tour guide takes pictures of the group the whole time, so once you return to the house they can share the photos with you. \n\nOnce everyone is ready you head back to town in the minibus. If you are traveling with a group that does not want to kayak they can sign up for the ropes/ zip line course - it’s the same bus and the groups are combined. \n\nScandinavia is very expensive and this tour was a huge value for kayak rental, 6 hours of total 'tour' time, plus lunch. Excellent experience, friendly, laid back guide.",

      "text": "A fjord tour is a must to see some of the best that Western Norway has to offer. We chose Sognefjord which included over 5 hours on the boat from Bergen to Flam. The Flam railway to Myrdal, returning to Bergen on a scheduled train from Myrdal. It is a long day, around 12 hours, and it is fairly pricey. However we felt it was value for money. The long boat trip disappeared due to the stupendous scenery, and you do travel in comfort. The Flam railway is a miracle of engineering with a vast number of photo opportunities in an hours journey. The train to Bergen takes just short of 3 hours, but again is very scenic despite being punctuated by numerous tunnels. A long but rewarding day to the Queen of fjords if you love incredible scenery.",

      "text": "We travelled (more like raced) through the Nordic cities with our 12 year old grandson, so the best we could do for all of us to enjoy seeing a beautiful fjord was to do the day trip trip from Bergen.   We chose to go via Voss because it arrives back in Bergen one hour earlier and we had much to see and do in Bergen that evening.   The forecasters said rain and we got a beautiful day.    From the moment I booked the tour online and we collected our tickets at the Bergen train station, everything went perfectly and we are so glad we spent the money to do this.   The drive down by coach from Voss to Gudvangen is spectacular;  the time spent walking around Gudvangen very pleasant, and the fjord cruise simply beautiful.   In Flam we just had time to visit the Train Museum, before catching the Flam railway to Myrdal.   That was very special, the surprise for our grandson was the \"lady in red\" which I had read about!",

Ninety percent of the journey is the standard rail journey from Oslo to Bergen apart from the bit between Myrdal and Voss so don’t repeat our mistake of returning to Oslo by rail expecting something new!\n\nThe longest section is from Oslo to Myrdal (five hours) The scenery is spectacular.\n\nIt had been warm at Oslo but high up at Myrdal several extra layers of clothing were necessary.\n\nThe Fram Railway descends steeply to Fram at sea level. The scenery on this one hour journey put everything previous into the shade.\n\nThe rail trip is followed by a two hour cruise down the fjord which again was majestic though the second hour dragged a little.\n\nThe link between Gudvangen and Voss took just over an hour. Because it was summer we detoured by a precipitous road (thankfully one way only) with countless hairpin bends. I am sure that had the bus been two feet longer it would have been unable to negotiate them.  Unless you have a strong stomach and a good head for heights avoid the window seats.\n\nThe journey from Voss to Bergen took two hours.\n\nIf you add all these times together you will be well short of eleven and a half hours. This is because there is a fair bit of hanging around waiting foe trains etc.\n\n‘Norway in a Nutshell’ will be the abiding memory of our holiday.",

      "title": "Being dumped in a sleepy town at 8 am is NOT my idea of a good time",
      "text": "This review is specifically about the HARDANGER FJORD in a Nutshell. My husband and I together with another couple went on a 2-day version of this tour, where we took the 11 am boat from Bergen to Rosendal, the were taken to Odda to stay the night, and the following day returned to Oslo via Hardanger Fjord.\n\nThe tour looked wonderful. Unfortunately, it became a chapter of accidents that were so farcical that at one point I turned to my friends and told them that I felt as if I were in Fawlty Towers.\n\nIt started well. The boat trip from Bergen was lovely, and we arrived at Rosendael on time at 1:00 pm. However, no-one had informed us that it takes ONE HOUR to get up to the castle garden PLUS ONE HOUR to get down again. As the bus was due to leave at 2 pm, it was impossible to enjoy this part of the tour (the reason I'd booked the tour in the first place.)\n\nBut worse was to follow. Someone remarked that the bus was NOT coming at 2 pm (as WRITTEN on our instructions) but was actually arriving at 1:38. Where to wait? Our instructions told us the bus would take us from the quay where the boat had left us. \n\nThis turned out to be NOT true. Instead we had to walk to the road, cross over it and wait for the bus there.\n\nHowever, the bus arrived and took us to Odda, where my husband and our friends stayed at the Hardanger Hotel (which was fine.) One problem with touring around remote regions in Norway is that it IS DIFFICULT to find ANYWHERE DECENT to eat. The possibilities near our hotel were not what we wanted, and so we HIKED THIRTY MINUTES UPHILL to get to the Trolltunga Hotel, where we had a wonderful evening.\n\nThe next day, however was NOT so good. For some reason, this trip DEMANDED that we get on the bus that LEFT Odda AT 7:25! This meant that we had to get up EARLY and eat a quick breakfast to make sure we were on it. (As there was ONLY ONE a day, we would have been stuck in Odda if we'd missed it.)\n\nWe duly got on the bus, and it took us to Loftus, arriving at 8 am in the morning. Places such as Loftus, while charming to look at from a boat, are NOT the most exciting places to be at that time. The town was asleep. There were no cafes open. The grocery store was shut. There were no bathroom facilities. And a VERY COLD WIND was coming off the lake. The bus (a public bus, commandeered by the tour planners) deposited and LEFT.\n\nWhile we were wondering what to do, we met some of our fellow travelers, including a charming young lady from Spain who informed us that she had MISSED the bus the previous day, having thought it would leave at 2pm (when it actually left at 1:38.) She said she was obliged to take a VERY EXPENSIVE TAXI RIDE in order to get to her hotel for that night. I REALLY REALLY HOPE THAT YOU REFUND HER MONEY AND APOLOGIZE TO HER.\n\nFinally, after hunting around, we found a hotel that allowed us to use its facilities and sit by its fire in exchange for our buying coffee and snacks. \n\nWe had to wait TWO AND QUARTER HOURS for the boat to arrive to take us to Ulvik. The 10:15 bus arrived on time, but I couldn't understand why the tour planners had roused us from our beds so early to deposit us in the back of beyond to wait over 2 hours for a boat that wasn't going to depart until mid-morning. \n\nThe rest of the tour was fine, but we were wiped out from having to get up at 5 am in the morning, and from all the changes we had to make from boat to bus to boat to bus to train. It was an exhausting trip, and after the way we were treated I WOULDN\"T RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE.",

It is a VERY GOOD IDEA to have your hotel check your luggage in Bergen by rail and pick it up at the end of the trip at the train station in Oslo.    The trip:  train from Bergen to Voss,  then a bus to the village of Gudvangen (God’s Garden),  a Fjord Boat sailing the Naeroyfjord and Aurlandsfjord and they are indescribably beautiful!!!!  Ending in Flam and if the old hotel is open (seasonal) have lunch.  Delicious and fresh foods, very fresh. Then the famous Flam Railway up and up and through mountains and more mountains to the village of Murdal.  Santa probably lives close by!!  Then a fast train to Oslo.  The scenery for every segment of the trip is amazing and fun and amazing.  Make sure you carry a bag with your passport, medications, cameras, iPads, change of clothes,  local cash and credit cards.  Once in Oslo,  a taxi or pre-arranged driver to take you to your hotel.  Take a raincoat and layer, even during summer.",

We started 20 minutes late as the guide decided to wait for two people who never showed up and cut our time 20 minutes short, meaning we only got 30 minutes in the water. We we were very disappointed by this and when we raised it with the guide he shrugged and said they had another tour after us.

Once the boat had finished a bus is waiting to collect you, and you get the train back to Bergen from Voss. The whole day went really smoothly, there transport runs to time (unlike the UK) we were advised to bring food with us on the trip, but there was plenty of places to buy stuff as well. I couldn't recommend this trip enough, It's a great way to see the start of the Fjords. I would definitely recommend.",

While I realize we might have saved a few dollars if we'd booked on our own, I thought the ease of doing it through Fjord Tours was worth it.  My advice to anyone doing this is to take several days to travel between Oslo and Bergen.  I can see how it would feel rushed and chaotic doing it in one day.  We chose the Sognefjord tour and would recommend it. This was our schedule which worked well. \n\nOslo - picked up tickets at Oslo Central Station the day before.  Each person had a packet of tickets already assembled which made it easy. \n\nFinse - traveled four hours on the Bergen Railway and then got off at Finse to stay at FInse 1222.  Fantastic old hotel where scenes from Hoth (Empire Strikes Back) were filmed.  Very remote and beautiful. \n\nFlam - left Finse on the Bergen Railway, changed to Flam Railway at Myrdal.  This can be a little confusing, but all you need to do is walk through the station to the other side where you'll find the Flam Railway.  No assigned seating, but they take your luggage at the end of the platform and you board the car you want.  It was busy when we were there, but not crazy.  No problem for our family of four to sit together.  Got off the Flam Railway and spent the night in Flam.  We did book the Fjord Safari with Goat Cheese tour through Fjord Tours. Do it if you are staying in Flam.  This was a highlight. \n\nBalestrand - took the express boat from Flam and got off in Balestrand.  Beautiful fjord village with a historic hotel.  We stayed at the Balestrand Hotel and highly recommend it.  Get a room with a balcony and fjord view. \n\nBergen - took the express boat from Balestrand to Bergen.  It's a four hour boat ride, but very enjoyable.  We loved being on deck to see the fjords.  It was raining on and off, but that didn't detract from our experience.  With periods of rain and sun, we saw multiple rainbows. Spectacular!",

I looked into buying the tickets myself so we could save money and I know tons of other people do it this way, but I didn't want to take any chances on doing something wrong or missing one of the modes of transportation. Everything was self-explanatory and smooth, besides some delays (because I bought through the company, I didn't have to worry). \nMy trip was the first week in June, so it wasn't as crazy busy as it can get during peak season. If you do travel during peak season, my advice would be to relax and try to go with the flow---everyone is trying to enjoy their time. A lot of negative reviews for this tour seem to be related to being disgruntled because of crowds. If you travel at this time of year, don't expect to be alone!\nI took SO many pictures during the tour, especially on the boat. I paid extra for the premium boat and it was very nice. We were staying in Bergen (LOVE Bergen! It is very laid-back compared to other Scandinavian cities) so we did the roundtrip Bergen-Bergen. It was the perfect amount of time.

We started with one tour bus for about an hour and a half. There were plenty of stops to see waterfalls and lovely countryside. We then switched to another bus which took us to the fishing town of Vikk.  It’s too bad that no one told us that everything in Vikk is closed on Sundays.  In fact nothing is really open in Norway on Sundays. We had three hours to waste in Vikk before boarding the boat to see the Sognefjord. There was one fast food restaurant open near the dock. My son and I had a very expensive, horrible hamburger. What could we do? There was nothing else open. The bun was old and there was corn in my burger. Who puts corn in a hamburger? Once the ferry arrived we were excited to see the fjords. Once on board we were extremely disappointed to find out there were no assigned seats on the ferry. If fact, people took up seats with their luggage and belongings. We didn’t have a seat at all for the whole duration of the trip! There was also no commentary on the fjords either. The trip turned out to be about 12 hours long, and extremely expensive! I would not recommend this trip at all! So disappointed!",

      "text": "Fjord tours seem to sell the tours and that is it.  Thereafter it’s left to the railway companies and staff and the ferry operators to pick up the pieces. \n\nChaos at Bergen station today with insufficient carriages available. Unfortunately groups from the end of the queue were allowed to queue jump and generally the situation was a mess. Fjord tours reps nowhere to be seen.  \n\nFor those who got on, train was packed, standing room only for many. Many disembarked at Voss for a different tour, rushing for buses. At Myrdal The flamsbahne was less busy but no time to take the scenery at the top. The descent is impressive but I’m glad our train was not full - maybe there were spaces as many people had  been prevented from starting their journey in Bergen. \n\nGood views of the fjord from the marina but then joined boat queue early to make sure we got on! You are not guaranteed a seat and as the whole point is to see the view you need a window seat or one outdoors if it’s dry, so another scrum...... but the boat trip was really worth it especially the last hour or so and the arrival in Bergen. \n\nI think I would recommend doing the trip but making your own arrangements and booking directly with ferry or using a car.  Go to the Tourist info centre in Bergen or the railway station to see what you can do on your own. I think the ti Centre is no longer selling fjord tours for the company due to recent problems. \n\n",

      "text": "Norway in a Nutshell is a day tour to visit a fjord on a premium cruise boat. This tour on July 26 was as poorly organized as I could imagine. There was a rail outage that occurred on July 24, as far as I could tell. We were not informed until we arrived at the train station to pick up our tickets. The information was shared with us by the rail employees. No one from Fjords tour appeared to be present. There was a lot of speculation as how we were to get to the dock. It had been scheduled to include rail and bus. Because of the rail outage, another method would be needed to get us to Voss. The way to get us to Voss would be either by bus or by taxi.\n It appears that the one bus that was present would not load passengers as they had not had authorization from Fjord tours. Everyone was left to manage on their own. My family, 6 of us. went with 2 cabs which we organized. When we got to the next stage (Voss) there was no transport to take us to Gudvangen. Again there was a bus there but it was at least 45 minutes before he had authorization to take us to Flam. When we arrived at the port, the scheduled boat had left and we made the decision to go on a converted ferry boat to do the tour. All of this was done without any identifiable Fjord Tour representative. The return was equally frustrating as again there were 2 buses but they waited for at least 40 minutes before they had authorization from Fjord Tours to load passengers..\n\nThose of us who have travelled a lot know that there will be unexpected glitches and when they are explained, most people will accept this. What is unacceptable is total silence from the organizer. \n\nWe have heard nothing from Fjord Tours. Another disappointment.\n\nWe were told by some people in Bergen that Fjord Tours WERE good at one time but that their business has out gown their ability to manage.\nFortunately, the fjord is beautiful andf the weather was wonderful.",

      "text": "I went on the Sognefjord in a Nutshell trip during August 2018. Overall the trip was exceptional due to the incredible scenery and wilderness of Norway, however it was very crowded and a lot of people on the trains/boat. \n\nI booked a few weeks in advance, it fit in really well with the limited time I had available in the South of Norway. I picked up my tickets the day before at Oslo airport, and they went through the details about which trains had reserved seating etc. I was a bit anxious that I would miss a train or not be able to find where to go with all the trains etc, but it was very easy to follow and everyone is very helpful!\n\nThe day started off early in at Oslo Central Station departing on the train for Myrdal. If you can, I would highly recommend a window seat for this train, as the scenery, especially in the second half was incredible!! From Myrdal station we jumped on the Flåm Railway heading to Flåm, this train trip took around an hour with a few stops along the way. Which ever side of the train you snag a seat on (get a window seat) is incredible as you descent from 800m above sea level to around 20m above. \n\nYou'll have some time in Flåm to wander around the gift shops, cafes, food trucks, and take in the incredible view of the fjord. Next we jumped on the boat for the 5 hour cruise through Sognefjord. Again, grab a window seat on the boat, or one at the front of either the bottom or top deck to take in the incredible views of the Fjord all the way to Bergen. \n\nI would recommend a warm jacket for this trip as it was chilly waiting for the trains/boat, and it was summer! Also, I bought lots of food along for the trip but it isn't necessary as there are kiosks on the trains and boats and lots of great food available in Flåm. \n\nI took the overnight train from Bergen to Oslo due to time restraints, but would have loved to have spent the night in Bergen and seen it during the day as it seemed like a beautiful city!\n\nOverall the trip was incredible, so much packed into 24 hours, I would highly recommend it to anyone who has a day free in the south of Norway!",

The cruise boat was crowded but we managed to get lots of pictures.  The fjords were majestic and the little towns along the way were quaint and looked just like a calendar. Gudvangen was where the cruise ended.  A picturesque town I wish we could have had time to explore. The tour includes a detour as the bus driver took us up narrow road that included hairpin turns on the way down.  It was a wonderful treat.  All the transportation were right on schedule and got us into Bergen to settle in.   So this is not a leisurely kind of tour and if you don't enjoy rushing ,  it may not be for you.",

We had a little over an hour in Flam so got some lunch and then took the Flam railway which had wonderful views. The train trip back to Bergen was fine although there were no working restrooms on the train which was a problem as it was a two hour trip, plus the time on the Flam railroad. There was only one and it was out of order. There was a LONG line for the restrooms once we got to Bergen! \nYou should know that this tour isn't really organized by a specific tour group - these are different modes of public transportation so you could buy tickets separately or customize the tour as you like.",

We’d booked 4 months in advance, but discovered that tickets are sold but NO NUMBERED SEATS .... you have seats in a ‘first on, best served’ basis. Anyone who tried to board the Flåm Railway Train in the 15-20 minutes before it left (as we were advised on the day), had great difficulty finding seats (especially of there were 2 or more in your group). Not having window seats means you can’t see the views easily, nor take photos easily. People were angry at not having allocated seats. When we transferred onto the ‘normal train’ for the 2 hour trip back to Bergen, it was the same: no allocated seats. Lots of trouble. We’d suggest NOT paying the company to purchase your tickets (as you get nothing for this privilege), but rather look up the timetables yourself and just book (it won’t mean you’ll get allocated seats, but it might save you a bit of money)",

We had them mailed to us and they arrived 90 days before- so mid April.  This is the second time I have done Norway in  Nutshell.  Last time was 17 years ago with just my husband and me.  This time, we took our teenage sons.  We chose to leave from Oslo, spend the night in Aurland (next to Flam), and then stay again in Bergen.  We booked all our hotels and train/boat/bus connections through them and it all worked out perfectly.  Our first night we arrived in Oslo we stayed in the Thon Panorama and had a nice room on the 6th floor with balcony- only about a 10 minute walk to Oslo Central Station.   The next morning our train left Oslo early (the train was about an hour late- not the fault of Fjord tours), but we had a beautiful ride to Myrdal.  Nice seats, food in the restaurant car, wonderful.   Switched trains for the Flamsbana and it was a beautiful ride.  When in Flam we took a city bus to Aurland about 10 minutes away.  We stayed in a fisherman cabin in the Vansgaarden.  It was so quaint and wonderful.  The scenery is breathtaking.  The next afternoon we took the shuttle back to Flam to board the fjord cruise boat.  Don't worry if you don't have a place to sit down.  People move all around and you will want to stand outside anyway.  It is a 2 hour boat ride and gorgeous.  We were lucky and had nice weather, but even if it rains you can sit inside.  The bus from Gudvangen to Voss is amazing.  Confortable seats and large windows- very relaxing and beautiful ride.  The driver takes you up to the top of a mountain to see the view of the fjord and it is a great ride- lots of hairpin bends and waterfalls.  When we got to Voss we were ticked to take the train to Bergen, but the train was cancelled.  Again, not the fault of fjord tours- electrical problems caused the shut down.  However, they sent busses to replace the trains and every things was just fine.  We arrived in Bergen at the same time and again the scenery was tremendous.  When we got to Bergen we stayed in the Thon Orion.  This hotel has an excellent location to sites in downtown Bergen.  The room was small, but adequate and it is nice they also serve a free dinner.  All in all, I would hands down book through Fjord tours to do all these connections and hotels.  If you order early enough and have it mailed to you you have hard copies of all the reservations, paper tickets, and a nice photo brochure that explains all the places you will see.  I don't know why people complain about this- I have done it twice (17 years apart) as a couple and as a family and both times it was super easy, effieient, and the way to go.  Highly recommend.  ",

As a local, he was very knowledgable about the area and was able to share a lot about the Norwegian culture with me, which I really enjoyed. He was also very kind in going out of his way to help me when I was having trouble purchasing a train ticket and getting to the station. As for the hike itself, WOW! The views were absolutely out of this world! One of the best parts was that we only saw about 4 or 5 other people (all locals) during the entire hike. Definitely a highlight of my trip to Norway. If you're searching for a one-of-a-kind hiking experience that is tailored to your interests and needs, look no further!",

There was two different methods to figure out one puzzle which was confusing because they weren't identical and we ended up wasting time trying to find the relevance of one of the pathways (I think one should be removed for simplicity as in the escape rooms I've completed previously they haven't offered two pathways). I read a review that too many clues were given, but I think it's gone the opposite way now. We were far from escaping without realising (can't elaborate or it will spoil it), so I think in this case (as we weren't to know how far off we were) clues should be offered (you can obviously always ask, but the problem is only they know if you need them based on how far through they know you are). Clues are typed on a screen so maybe to keep all clients happy, something along the lines of \"do you need help with...?\". Also we were told not to touch objects with a hands off symbol, but it turns out you need to touch a lock on one of these objects so that was also a source of confusion. The staff explained this in Norwegian to a friend in the beginning so it may have gotten lost in translation...  \n\nAnyway, the staff were nice and there's some interesting things in the room. I imagine it will only get better!",

Fjords are not covered with ice. But to get to the Hardanger fjord we have passed mountain region with small cabins covered with snow. We enjoyed this tour. Recommendation to stay for your lunch in Hardangerfjord hotel. Location is perfect",

The puzzles are solvable (we finished it with about 45 minutes to spare) but also challenging enough to be incredibly fun. The staff are also a pleasure to deal with and great to get recommendations from. Highly recommended, especially if you’re not in Bergen for too long or at the beginning of a longer stay!",

This Company was great in giving out suggestions and recommendations from the hotels to the places to visit in Iceland.\nOur group: I am with Senior citizens who have slight mobility problems. I have made prior planning with JANDIS for making the tour senior citizen-friendly. They have exceeded my expectations in  this area.\n\nGuide: Denis is a great guide. Excellent service. I have been organizing trips for almost 5 years now and I have had many experiences with coordinating and corresponding with guides, Denis is probably one of the most courteous guides I have ever encountered. In terms of knowledge, Denis really knows Norwegian history, geography and popular culture. We had him for 2 full days and we could not ask for more. Coming from the Sunny side of the Earth, we can definitely say that we learned a lot from him.\n\nAlso appreciate the short side trip after fetching us at the airport. Should have been just an airport pick-up but he went out of the way to show us the scenic road to our hotel. \n\nFor this entire north Europe trip, Denis is the best driver we had. Great job. Would recommend this Company in a heartbeat.",

I was very grateful for the recommendation from the tourist office when I explained that I was looking for good local beer, that was just what I got.  Great beer menu by the way such a wide range of choice.",

As others have mentioned, we wish we'd done this the very first thing, since we had such a fantastic guide who told us about the city, its history, and about contemporary culture in Bergen and around Norway. Our walk was well paced for a family group (short distances with stops where some could sit down) and we enjoyed the food (snacks at the beginning and sit-down places with a substantial soup and drinks at one, sweets at another, and more drinks at a third) quite a lot. We also got a thorough tour of the historic trading quarter of Bergen. However, the best thing about it was our guide, Victoria. She was so knowledgable and enthusiastic, fully of great stories and happy to respond to all our questions.",

We decided to walk around and see what comes our way. Accidentally we found this place and started talking with a nice young lady. Through her we got the idea to go up the mountain with e-bikes. So we did and I believe it was a much better way then going with Floibanen. We could stop wherever we wanted, take in different views and riding through endless rows of old wooden houses. The e-bikes were great and it was so much fun! There is many different ways to go up and down. Forest trails or perfect asphalt. We went up the forest trail and down the asphalt way. No problem for the bikes.  No need to stand in any line wasting time. This was a perfect thing to do when having just a few hours. Thank you Base Camp Bergen for such a kind and helpful service and advice. We will be back, and then we do the zip line!",

      "text": "Overall, our experience with Fjordtours and the Norway in a nutshell self-guided tour was positive. However, Their customer service certainly could be improved upon. I emailed them a few days before our trip, concerned with the fact that we did not have actual tickets or seat assignments. I was emailed another copy of what we had already printed out and  was told that that was all that we needed for the trip— still no seat assignments.  However when we arrived at the train station in Bergen Norway we were informed that we needed to have seat assignments. The ticket office  told us that the Fjordtours representative would be there at the station at 8am. We were there an hour early and had plenty of time to take care of any issues that might arise but we never saw a Fjordtours representative.  \nHowever, we learned by email later that the representative was there  wearing a similar yellow vest as the security personnel and did not make her presence known. Therefore, when we boarded the train we had to go from seat to seat until we were not bumped  by someone who actually had that seat assigned.  We also did not have a seat assignment for the train from Myrdal to Oslo. When I contacted Fjordtours about the issue, the emailed response was cavalier and very defensive.\n Although the lack of seat assignments was stressful, the scenery was breathtaking and the trip, although long, was worthwhile. \n Be advised that that final leg of the trip might take longer than the train schedule indicates. We arrived at the Oslo station almost 40 minutes late and did not get to our hotel until nearly midnight. A long day for us!",

It was a bit pity that we are unable to stay longer during the stay in gudvangen for the Viking market which was the last day. But overall we did enjoy the tour and following it was easy. however if it rains it will be more ideal to engage the luggage porter service that the fjord tour has offer. As it will be easier to travel around. Even though it is still accessible to carry the luggage with you around the whole trip. But without it, you will enjoy the tour better.",

We left Bergen on the 06.50 train and it was an easy transition to all the following stages with only 30 mins or so between each and then an hour in Voss before catching the train back to Bergen. It was surprisingly quiet on the trains and boat, this was a Saturday so perhaps that helped. Travelling in Bergen’s heatwave we were delighted to find comfortable air conditioned transport and the premium boat was lovely.",

      "text": "My 7 year old son and I did our Norway in a Nutshell tour last year for my birthday - *May 2018 (forgive the late review). I spent months researching for my trip and was immediately drawn to this tour - based on their site and other online reviews. While I was extremely intimidated at first (no personal guide)... it all worked out seamlessly. \n\nWe did Oslo to Bergen - round-trip..and we spent 5 glorious days in Bergen...after a very hectic.. but fun week in Oslo. This is not a journey for the faint of heart...it is indeed a LOT to cover in one day.. I even met people who did a full turnaround back to Olso on the overnight train... While I wouldn't recommend that... for those that are short on time... it's a great option. You must understand that you can stretch this journey out to YOUR LIKING....so really think about the stops and if you want to spend a night or 2 in various locations. \n\nThe train ride from Olso to Flam was just incredible... there aren't enough words to describe the beauty....Even at the end of May, we were still able to see wonderful glaciers....just starting to melt...along with such picturesque hills...rivers...farms...small homes... It was truly breathtaking. A few of my photos look like they belong in a Monet watercolour collection...it was that amazing... \n\nTransferring to the Flam Railways was a great ride....very steep train ride... and high! just amazing...Waterfall stop was quick.... but good photo opp! ... I booked so that we had a nice 3 hour break in Flam... before our Fjords tour in the afternoon..and it was so needed....Despite the Flam visitor center being a bustling grand central for all travelers/other cruise passengers.... we were able to have a great lunch and a nice nap!.(the chairs were all couches with cushions)....We had time for ice cream and got  to stretch our legs....take in the views...and not be rushed.  Many other travelers were running for their boat straight after our train ride...I'm so glad I booked with a break instead. Our Premium fjord boat was beautiful! Gorgeous leather chairs everywhere.. luggage storage..immaculate bathrooms....Be prepared for multiple temp changes and high wind!.... We stayed outside for the entire ride to take it all in! and it was beautiful.....We went from our tank tops and hot sun in Flam..to our coats/fleece sweaters/scarves in about 30 minutes ha..Some people preferred to sit at the back of the boat... while most of us were up front for the best pictures.  Bus to Voss had some hairpin turns! .We had an incredible driver.......by this time....we took another nap... Be prepared for a 10 minute walk with your luggage to the next train..(strong luggage! no cheap wheels)...\n\nOur final train to Bergen from Voss got us there by 9pm....with the sun still out...of course... and from there...we really enjoyed ourselves in Bergen..so much to see and do...I highly recommend a stay here if you can fit it in....We had a fantastic Airbnb... walked everywhere each day.. best seafood at their market...hiking. on Mount Floyen... take your kids to see the Troll Forest there.. really fun .. Took our train back to Oslo the night before our departure home... and it was perfect.\n\nNote for PARENTS -\n\nPS - the food on the NSB train is actually really good! Have the meatballs with potatoes and gravy :).... Also the snacks and chocolates as well....great treats to have while in the dining car. Also - there is a Family car on the NSB train - which has a small room for kids to play and watch movies... They also give out a cool Kids Kit to each child with crayons/drawing books..etc.... We enjoyed spending an hour in there....then went back to our seats....- If you have small babies and/or loud children lol - you can request seats in the Family car. Otherwise, QUIET in all other seats/areas on the train.\n\nDo pack light...1 suitcase or backpack per person...make sure each child can carry/roll their own bags...or consolidate as best as you can....Hauling luggage on/off trains/boats/buses all day is exhausting ..so make sure you've packed as light as possible.\n\nALSO - note - if you are picking up your train tickets from the Airport in Oslo - check for public holidays!  We arrived on one (May 21st - 2018 - Whit Monday)...and they weren't there for almost 3 hours after we arrived from our overnight flight...You can pick them up at Oslo Central - but just something to keep in mind if you want to get them straight after you arrive by flight.\n\nI wouldn't hesitate from booking this tour again on our next visit....and we'll stop off in other places...\n\nHighly recommend! Enjoy Norway!",

The Bus from Gudvangen to Voss was entertaining with good scenery. The Train from Voss to Bergen was also good. The Flam was somewhat disappointing. Expectations were high. The Scenery was great in some spots but there was significant time spent in tunnels. Reviews suggested that the left side of the train had the best views but we found that the scenery was probably equal on both sides of the train. If you have limited time in Norway then we would recommend this tour but we did find that there is better scenery if you explore further.",

      "text": "This self-guided tour is an exceptional way to see the best of western Norway's scenery in a day. There were only two slight hic-coughs which did not mar the day. The first was the transition from train to bus at Voss; the bus is a standard service bus (I think it was the 460) and there was only one at the bus station (adjacent to the train station) when the train containing the hordes of \"Nutshell thing\" tourists arrived. Chaos as there were hordes of us, many with voluminous luggage as obviously breaking the trip into a couple of days. Fortunately three more buses showed up quite quickly and everything settled down. The bus ride down the Stalheimskleiva was great fun, the driver stopping at several turns for the photo opportunities - a highlight of our two week sojourn in Norway. After transferring to the 'green' ferry at Gudvangen, the trip to Flam was brilliant especially down the Naeroyfjord, do enjoy the coffee and snacks available as you view the many waterfalls as the cafes in Flam get really busy. The ferry is very quiet and has plenty of space so all can get good photo opportunities. The train from Flam to Myrdal is spectacular and again provides good photo vantage points, perhaps seats on the right hand side of the train facing forwards are best. The second hiccough was the train back to Bergen; according to our tickets we had to change at Voss, however it was the same train despite having seperate seat reservations for the two sections Myrdal-Voss and Voss-Bergen! The conductor enligtened us to this fact when he checked our tickets. A really enjoyable day; a must do from Bergen if you have the time.",

Both places lovely to be at in the evening & early morning before and after all the tourist busses & ferries.  Spectacular scenery right on the Fiords.  This followed by a scenic bus trip to Voss then train to Bergen where we spent 2 nights at the Thon hotel Rosenkrantz which was excellent.  Thoroughly recommend this trip.",

We caught two trains, the first Bergen to Mýrdal followed by the Flam railway which stopped at an amazing waterfall until we reached the fjords. We will never forget the lushness of the countryside and the little villages dotted around the fjords. On our return we caught a bus which went on a picturesque route to Voss and from there we trained it back to Bergen. All in all the trip was 11 hours. No food was provided so for just over 320 AUD we had tickets for the trains and the bus which were all co-ordinated. Had you purchased tickets on your own for each leg of the journey you’d be slightly in front but I’d say this is the way to do it. Tickets for this trip can be purchased from Bergen’s information centre.",

      "text": "I saw very mixed reviews about the Norway in a Nutshell Tours so I had some concerns when we chose to take a tour.   I am glad that we did the trip as we saw hundreds of waterfalls and the fjord had some wonderful scenery.  We had expected a guide who would give us information about what we saw. Instead, the tour seemed to be just a series of tickets that got you where you needed to be.  We did not see a guide and never heard any commentary, except that the Flåm Railway that had an audio-visual slide show at certain points and one bus driver gave us some information.  He was good. The materials we received  when we ordered the tour had a spot for “Practical Advice,” but for the most part offered none.  So if you go, be sure to print your tickets ahead of time. Go early enough so you can work out any questions you have.  Be self-sufficient.  Know where you need to go and if you are confused, the locals at the stops seemed to know where the Nutshell tours should go.  Our trip was Bergen-to-Bergen loop.  Our route had two places where you could get some food, but the food was about as good and economical as you would expect for places that serve visitors who have few options.  My suggestion would be to take some food with you.  I think the ease of having the tickets arranged for you was worth it.",

Beautiful view after beautiful view.  This is expensive and touristy but well worth it.  PS - there is a weird moment on the Flam train where a surprise dance performance takes place near a waterfall.",

It is an 8-9 hour day schleeping your suitcases around.  .... but I'm glad we didn't miss it.",

So the train to Myrdal was late and the Flamm railroad cars were already crowded when we arrived. Had to see this scenic portion of the trip riding backwards. Pouring rain in Flamm but the tiny town was very scenic- including a MSC cruise ship. Took the boat the next day- it was okay but not breathtaking. The pictures you see are from above, so that gives a completely different viewpoint. In Gudvangen we had to stand around and wait for a bus. This large bus had to navigate some very tight turns- the waterfalls were gorgeous but there could have easily been an accident. Arrived in Voss just in time to wait for the train to Bergen. Too much traveling and changing modes of transport for the scenes you saw.",

It is much cooler in the mountains and a warm jacket is a must. I took the Bergen Railway to Myrdal, the Flåm Railway to Guduanger (the Fjords via boat), a bus to Voss and the Bergen Railway back to my origination point. All transportation was clean, included restroom facilities and most had snack or food options. Exiting the Flåm Railway for the ferry provided a larger selection of restaurants, with a variety of food options such as snacks, sit down dining, or take a way meals from vendors and several quality souvenir shops.  Additionally there is a small complimentary museum on the Flåm Railway’s history. A mind boggling scenery with waterfalls, mountains, wildflowers and rivers everywhere you look - not to be missed.",

He spoke at the three museums and described the building exteriors and Bryggen environment as we walked.  By the end, participants really have a full idea of the history and importance of this beautiful area, all the better for appreciating a visit to Bergen and the west coast of Norway.

      "text": "A very informative and interesting tour of the old wharf section (Bryggen) of Bergen. Beginning inside the Bryggen Museum, we were able to get a good overview the city and the archeological finds of this oldest part of Bergen. The tour took us through the old Hanseatic buildings and our guide gave us a fascinating understanding of life during those times. Cod was king! So glad we were able to take this tour.  We were lucky, we in Bergen in late August and took one of the last available tours of the season. Don't miss this tour.  One grumpy older man from a cruise ship was annoyed there wasn't more walking involved and demanded a refund after 15 min in the museum. His loss!  It's not a nature tour (was that what he was expecting??)  but those who take it do need to know there are some stairs involved and you do walk a few blocks. Ric Steve's was right on this one.  Book early, it fills up.",

It was the perfect way to get a sense of Bergen’s history. Our guide was excellent and over the course of about 1.5 hours we made our way through three nearby museums and walked through the Bryggen district. The tour ticket also allowed for a same day return to each of the museums for a longer visit. It was an enjoyable morning and made the rest of our visit to Bergen more meaningful.",

      "text": "With this 90-minute-must tour you get all the history of Bergen and the Hanseatic League.  It’s a great way to start your visit.  Otherwise, you won’t know what you’re looking at.  Arriving early morning, we walked 15 minutes from our ship’s berth at the Bontelabo Dock to town and visited St. Mary’s Church (Mariakirken).  When the Bryggens Museum opened at 10:00 a.m., we bought our tickets for the 11:00 a.m. English tour.  The museum employees suggested walking through the neighborhood of old wooden houses located not far behind the museum before the tour started.  The costumed museum guides give the important points and are happy to assist.  However, they don’t project loudly so if hearing is a problem, consider hiring a private guide for a Bergen city walk.  (You can find one through the Official Bergen Guide on the tourist website.)    The Schøtstuene Assembly rooms and Hanseatic Museum rooms are small.  It was difficult with a group of 30 to get good pictures so right after the tour I went back into the Hanseatic Museum and did reshots.\n\nOther Notes on Your Bergen Day:\n\nThe Fløibanen Funicular was overcast so we walked through the Fish Market, Nordnes, and Sentrum (The Center).  Heading back from the Lake (Lille Lungegårdsvana), we stumbled upon the cute cobblestone street of Marken.\n\nCheck out my photo mapping a walk of old wooden houses in the Nordnes area given to me by a local guide.\n\nAs a note due to construction, the Bergenhus Fortress can only be visited on a tour right now.  There isn’t much you can do on your own.  The Bergen Cathedral (Domkirke) is also being renovated.",

The tour started inside the BRYGGENS MUSEUM where our guide touched on several exhibits important to the history of the wharf area. We didn't see everything in that museum but the Walking Tour ticket includes re-entry to all of the museums included in the tour (on that day only) so we went back later in the afternoon. At the SCHOTSTUENE  (the Hanseatic merchants meeting rooms) we learned more about the history of the Hanseatic trading community; I didn't know anything about this bit of history and found it well worth hearing about. After walking past the wooden houses we finished up the tour going through the HANSEATIC MUSEUM which was the home and warehouse of one of the merchants.",

We ended up ordering double shots of rum and vodka and a hard cider. Then one of our party ran a few doors down and bought a sprite and a Diet Coke to mix with our shots. \n\nI don’t blame the bartender for this. She only knows what she has been trained on. Management and Ownership are responsible. You lost money on us as we went in search of a real bar instead of us having a few drinks. You frustrated a new employee and didn’t give her any tools to do her job. ",

Ronny and the crew at God-Tur are skilled kayak instructors and guides and will customize your tour based on the capabilities and interests of your group. \n\nAs an experienced paddler, Ronny took me on a trip through the rocky archipelago of Glasvær that met and exceeded my expectations for a short kayak trip on the west coast of Norway. Ronny was highly knowledgable and genuinely enjoyed sharing his love of the sea with the group.\n\nIf you're looking for a quiet tour, some advanced sea kayak instruction or would like to try a multi-day adventure, Ronny will work with you to accommodate your needs and realize your dream of exploring the coast by kayak.",

Easy to deal with the pilot over email from abroad before the day, good communication with company. A hassle free experience and the paraglide was a great success - it’s such a beautiful location.  Very easy to access, our pilot Vincent met us just outside the cable car building and then a short walk to the spot\nOn the mountain where they took off from and we could all watch. They swooped past many times giving lots of opportunities for us on the ground to wave and take pics etc. thoroughly recommend. They landed at the football stadium and drove their guest back to the cable car car\nPark where we met up again after the rest of us had a lovely walk down the mountain (3.3km).  Fun to watch and fun to do!",

Jeg er en som har gjort en del erfaring med Escape room tidligere, og på grunn av dette synes jeg det ble litt lett. \nEn annen klage jeg har er at som rullestolbruker, føler jeg at jeg må påpeke at rommene var litt små, og trange dette gjelder også dørene. \nFor ordens skyld var det DNB jeg prøvde. Men håper å få tid, og ikke minst en gruppe venner med så jeg kan prøve festningen snart :)",

Choosing from a wall of gins from all parts of the world, you can get any cocktail you want or choose from a bunch you have never imagined.\n\nI even tried to confuse them by asking for a Sazerac cocktail when I saw that there was a bottle of Sazerac Rye on the wall.  The bartender did have to look it up, but did a good job on this New Orleans favourite. \n\nGreat drinks, friendly service made for a very enjoyable evening out with friends.\n\nVery highly recommended.

There is a sun deck and, downstairs, passengers sit in warm comfort. There is an on board kiosk for snacks and even a beer for those so inclined. \nWe were fortunate in that we went on the 10 am cruise and had good weather, before the Ellet and rain set in. I recommend you take the opportunity if the weather is fine and don’t put it off. ",

Bowling was fun and the place offers both beverages and food plus the pizza restaurant upstairs offers delivery. However this place is rather expensive at 86 nok per person per game, and two bottles of coke cost almost as much at over 35 nok per bottle. They offered free water, but it was lukewarm at a hot summer day, so not very enjoyable. All in all though, it was a fun time and we will be back (partly due to few other bowling places in Bergen, partly because of good service).",

Tickets for the funicular were included in the price; by afternoon the lines were exceedingly long.  She recommended that we wait until after the cruise and tour company passengers departed before we attempt the ride up to enjoy the view and she was so right!  The views in the evening are wonderful. She also recommended a great restaurant.  I would highly recommend a walking tour with this company.",

Meanwhile it was almost dark and we started listening to all the ehms and ahms and a view facts. The bus moved into a small road showing a sign for max. 12m. Construction work made the road even narrower and to reverse back out was the only option. An other 30 minutes. A 25 minute stop for sights in pouring rain at Bryggen made us leave the bus and catch a taxi for 184Kr.",

One loop is supposed to take 45 minutes with buses running every 30 minutes. We departed our cruise ship (NCL Jade) and along with a quite a few other people sought out the bus. The bus was parked just down from where the ship docked. The first bus filled up right away and another bus pulled right up. We save time by already having purchased the tickets, so it was quick to get on. The most popular stop it would seem it is the Mt. Floyen Funicular. We actually walked back (downhill) from this stop and we were fine.",

      "text": "Date of Visit:  Friday, Aug 31st, 2018 \n\nWe take the City Sightseeing worldwide hop on hop off bus tours in MANY cities we visit across the globe, and for the most Part I am a huge fan. I recommend it all the time when you have limited time to spend in a city.  We often only have 48 hour itineraries (or less) in many cities and it is a great way to see a city and get an overview of what it has to offer. You can then get out at the spots that are of interest, you learn a little about the different stops, and the city you are visiting. \n\nIf you plan on taking one of these Hp on / Hop off bus rides in multiple cities during your vacation - save your receipt - they give you a discount for multiples. \nWe took this in Bergen because we were with someone with slight mobility issues, and Bergen was a desitination of great sentimental value to her. So we wanted to see as much as possible. However, if we were alone - we would have just walked around.\nI didnt get a lot of value in this trip that I couldnt have done walking. \n\nIf you are a good walker - I suggest a self guided walking tour of Bergen - if you have any mobility issues - the bus is the way to go.\n\nThe bus is double decker - and the top floor is great for people who want to get photos that are not through a window - if you sit on the top - please note that it is either open air - or the windows will be opened by other passengers. This is very common - so people can get their photos. DO NOT come to the top level and start closing windows or complaining it is too cold - that is what the lower level is for. \n\nThe Cost of the Bus is about $50 USD per person. This is a very common price - mostly because it is the same company in many many cities. \n\nAs I reviewed on other city Sightseeing buses - They advertise \"free WiFi\" on the bus, at each seat, on the brochures, and even in the advertising of the voice guided tour.  \nHowever - this is such a joke. I have never had reliable wifi on any of these buses. \nIt sometimes logs in /connects, but it is so spotty, sketchy and unreliable - I wouldn't even waste your time trying. It is so frustrating. \n\nThe Seats are adequately comfortable - they do not make them more comfortable because they expect you will get up an Hop off periodically. \n\nThe ear plugs - wow - the cheapest things ever - they hurt. A Lot. \n\nThis is one city where I would recommend NOT taking the Hop On Hop Off if you have the ability to walk around.",

They are really there to make you feel safe, don't hesitate to throw intoxicated or aggressive people. Barmen and barmaids are efficient and friendly (they even smile!). The DJ is soooo awesome : zero time-out, the playlist does the job : everybody dances! And if you don't want to, you can sit down and chat, plenty of seats to do so. I met some lovely people in this bar too :) To sum up : perfect night for me, thank you!",

There are many pedestrians just strolling around.  Festivals and concerts, even protests are held here.   In the middle of the main square  is a sailor's monument/viking statue...pic attached.  Everything seems to be within walking distance.  There are many side streets filled with lots to see as well...on one I discovered a Gazebo surrounded by beautiful flowers, of course, depending on the season.  There are water fountains filled with children jumping around.  This square basically begins/ends by the Fish market, depending on your perspective.  It is also very close to Floibanen Funicular, which would take you up to Floyen mountain. \n\nQuite easy to get here from the cruise port, where we disembarked a ship.\nExit port, take a right, pass the sightseeing buses.  There is a signpost which, points the way to the City...\"Sentrum.\"  Once you get to fork in the road, stay to the right and this leads to Fish market, which would be to your right.  To your left, if you go up the street between the two big buildings, the one on your right says: \"Ann Madam,\" you will come to the Floibanen Funicular.   Beautiful ambience!",

Since we were on a cruise and they have stop #1 as the cruise terminal it was very convenient. It is a typical bus with ear buds they supply to listen to the taped city information. On this day there were 4 cruise ships in port. But I only saw 3 buses being used on their app. This caused us to wait about 45 minutes for the next bus at one stop. With a route of only 60 minutes I would have thought they could have kept to their 30 minute schedule. ",

We have been on a number of these type of tours in the past and this was the first time it was a recording. In addition we had to wait about 30 mins for the bus near the fish market and in that same time we saw 3 buses going the other direction. It seemed like a long wait. My biggest feedback is to tell travellers not to buy advance tickets. They say you’ll get 10% off so it entices you to buy early to save money. When we got there the tickets were 50% off and we still had to wait in line with everyone else from the cruise ship to change our online ticket to the ticket they needed. We felt ripped off. ",

We found that the double decker route was offring all fares for childrens' prices which turned out to be over 100NOR cheaper than the rivals. \n\nTickets are valid for 24 hours from purchase which is helpful if you are staying in the city. The cruise ship terminal is only visited when there are ships in.\n\nThe socket for the headphones for my pre-recorded information was not working but that was not too much of a loss.\n\nIf you have the time this is well worth sitting down for an hour and doing the circuit to orientate yourself.",

Clothes are hanging from corner to corner, and from era to era. In \"Slit'an! Vintage\" you can get fancy little purses from the 20s, a cool suit from the 60s, an elegant blouse from the 50s or just generally cool clothes from the 80s +++. \n\nEnok, the owner is super nice, and not to mention helpful. He has a lot of experience from the fashion industry and will gladly help you find your way through this big little shop.",

  "description": "Guided Fjord Tour to Nærøyfjorden, Flam and Stegastein. Also including two hours cruice on the fjord. Is there anything more enchanting than the breathtaking beauty of Norwegian nature, fjords, waterfalls and mountains? On this round with Fordrive AS, you can experience this amazing scenery first hand on a private road trip, including a two hour cruice on the Nærøyfjord. The tour starts by mini bus at the Tourist Information in Bergen, before heading east, where our first sightseeing stop will be at the magnificent waterfall, Tvindefossen. The tour continues towards Gudvangen, where we will drive down the amazing Stalheimskleiva. This is one of Northern Europe’s steepest road sections and has a fantastic view down towards the Nærøyfjord. We will then arrive at Gudvangen, where we will board the electric cruise, and arrive at Flam two hours later. We will then head to Aurland, and up to Stegastein. Stegastein has a unique and spectacular viewing platform that hangs 30 meters out!",

The tour was well thought out, with just enough of time at each stop.\n\nThe tour took in spectacular scenery along steep winding roads, not just the quick way through all the tunnels and the view from Stegastein was awe inspiring!\n\nThe air conditioned mini bus during a heatwave was really appreciated.\n\nThe Fjord cruise boat was breathtaking, on the \"Future of the Fjords\" boat which, being fully electric made the journey beautifully serene.\n\nOverall, a wonderful, personal tour, supporting a local small business. We would highly recommend this, a day well spent!\n",

      "text": "The Nærøyfjorden, Flam and Stegastein tour is absolutely breathtaking. We were looking for a day trip with a pace that was less frantic than the Norway in a Nutshell ones and found this. The groups are limited to 15 people which is the best size in my opinion, and Geir, our guide, runs his tours like clockwork. Everything went smoothly, the cruise is a highlight of the day and the landscapes alone are bigger than nature and well worth the price. The mix of road travel and cruise is great. A little more stories/facts on the region while on the road would be a nice addition I think but other than that it’s a perfect score for me. I’m surprised there isn’t more reviews on this little company because it’s a gem.",

Especially if I don't have time to research the city properly on my own or beforehand, it is worth my coin to book a photo tour to get the opportunity to take photographs as well as learn some historic facts about the place I'm visiting - be it for a few days or a week or even longer. Bergen Photo Walks's Iain is a knowledgable, witty and entertaining guide who took us on a discovery of this beautiful place buried amongst the fjords and mountains. \n\nAt first glance it feels and looks like any Scandinavian city usually does - wooden buildings, scenic waterfronts, mountain backdrops... Bergen is so much more as we discovered on our tour. \n\nExpect the weather to range from cold to warm, dry to wet and windy. Come properly prepared to do this walk with your camera and umbrella. Dress in layers is my best advice to anyone thinking of walking through Bergen. Wear comfortable shoes, because the terrain is not always tourist friendly.\n\nI've never been to Bergen before and Iain took us to some great spots for photographs, some off the beaten track as well as the more famous places. It helps that he is a keen photographer as well and he could assist with some of us not sure of ourselves. \n\nWe also went to Mount Fløyen and walked down through the beautiful forest. Along the way Iain suggested various shots as well as giving us some background information and history of the places we visited. He was patient in answering our questions about Bergen and Norway, and with a witty remark here and there he kept our spirits high even if the walk became a bit stiff for some.\n\nI include some of my photographs taken on this very memorable tour.\n\nThank you again, Iain, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend other tourists to contact you for their quick lesson in Norskie ;)",

Jose arranged for a guide in Bergen and also got us a hotel accommodations in downtown Bergen as short notice. One of our rooms also was upgraded. Overall a very satisfactory trip and I would highly recommend using Scandinavian Global Tours.",

She explained how Bergen had been built on the fish business and how the market had changed over the years.  We then were given several different kinds of salmon to taste.  From there we walked to a \"local's\" restaurant and sampled some fish soup, fish cake and some salads.  Next stop was a hot dog stand for a reindeer hot dog with lingonberry jam.  I'm not a fan of hot dogs, but this was good!  Our last stop was at a bakery in the Bryggen area.  We were stuffed when we were done and had a good idea of Norwegian and Bergen foods and the city.",

  "description": "You'll be surprised to find a club like Klubb KOK in a far away place like Bergen, but once you get to know the city, and it's vibrant music scene, the surprise just might wear of. Klubb KOK (pronounced with a long 'O', like in 'COOL') was named Bergen's Night Club Venue of the year in 2014, after only six months of operation. We are a leading supplier of high-quality cultural experiences, and have made a mark with quality events that usually fall under the genres of hip hop and house. We also arrange revolving art exhibitions, thus working closely with both the local music and art scene. We are open Tuesdays, Fridays and Saturdays - every week. Tuesdays we have the concept of \"Tirsdagsterapi\", or \"Tuesday Therapy\" in English, which opens at 21:00. We make the club smaller, cozier and more intimate. These evenings have become popular among young, creative people, and you meet a varied and interesting clientele. Fridays we open at 23:00 and we often start the weekend with a concert or a DJ-based club concept. Saturday is the great Party Day. We open at 22:30, and local, national and international DJs of world class standard play the best rhythmic dance music from genres such as hip hop, house, afrobeat, grime, bass, two step and the like. Klubb KOK are open to 03:30 in the morning all regular opening days. We have, among others, arranged concerts by artists such as: - Lars Vaular (NO) - Stormzy (UK) - Emil Stabil (DK) - Finnebassen (NO) - Gilli (DK) - Sebastian Ingrosso (SE) - D Double E (UK) - A-laget (NO) - Axel Boman (SE) - The Magician (BE) - Chopstick & John Jon (DE) - Daniel Bortz (DE) - General Knas (SE) - Klumben & Raske Penge (DK) - Ralph Myerz (NO) - Store P (NO) - Total Freedom (US) - Drippin (NO) - Lord Sivas (DK) - Unge Ferrari (NO) - Arif (NO) - Joddski (NO) - Sinjin Hawke (CA)",

Ich wurde vor der definitiven Bestellung mehrmals wirklich sehr nett beraten, alle meine Fragen wurden geduldig beantwortet und bei allen Anproben herrschte eine so freundliche Atmosphäre, wie ich es selten erlebt habe. Die zwei Frauen, die mich ausmassen und bedienten hatten wirklich Ahnung von dem was sie sagten und machten und es ging jedes Mal schnell und problemlos. Nicht einmal versuchten sie mir irgend etwas aufzuschwatzen, ich fühlte mich völlig frei und tritzdem gut beraten in all meinen Entscheidungen. Die Tracht werde ich mit Stolz tragen und viel Freude daran haben. Herzlichen Dank!!",

The prices weren't terrible divided among the table. I think the beer would be a better deal than the shots. The shots seemed like liquer rather than hard alcohol, and were a bit of gamble as to whether you would get one that tasted delicious, rather than medicinal.\nThe music was great, and everyone was dancing on the tabletops.",

  "description": "Opplev en 3,5 times World Heritage Tour mellom bratte fjell og dype fjorder inn gjennom det gamle vikingland og den berømte tidevannsstrømmen, Mostraumen. Turen går fra Zachariasbryggen, like ved det berømte Fisketorget i Bergen. Videre går vi inn til vakre Modalen, landets nest minste kommune med bare rundt 380 innbyggere før den returnerer til Bergen. På vei ut fra Bergen passerer vi Bryggen som i dag er inkludert i Unesco’s liste over verdens kulturarv, gamle Skuteviken, Sandviken og forbi gamle Bergen. Så på denne turen får en også oppleve Tørrfiskhistorien i Bergen og de unike bygningene. Det er guide med på turen i juni og juli. (etter dette kan det bli endringer). Landskapet inn via det gamle Vikingland til Mostraumen er vilt og vakkert. Enda mer vilt og vakkert blir det etter at vi har gått oppgjennom den berømte tidevannselven Mostraumen der majestetiske fjell stiger bratt opp på begge sider av Mofjorden til ca 1200 moh.",
